Worth the money,Can be surely preferred as your first iphone Value for money Some what battery is not sufficient but as we already know about the batteries of iphone Camera is up to mark but there is insufficiency of night mode wideangle mode but that‚Äôs ok its not a big deal Display performance is good enough Overall lookup is impressive and off course attractive Speakers are mind blowing dual speaker setup which is quite loud compared to others At this price range this phone is best if you are intere...
Super!,Great camera for pics and videos Battery life is good so far with some setting turn of which i never use and when i use i turn those on and i use it in power saving mode all the time so a full day with light gaming of 1hr or more using camera for 1hr or more listening music in my car on youtube and Bluetooth on for couple of hours it gives me full day of battery varing from 4/5 to 6/7 hours sot per dayPerformance is top notch plays every game and every task with easeVery premium phone look...
Classy product,One of Best phone in 2020..Excellent Camera and Performance..battery also good without Games..Thanks u Flipkart Best offer and fastest delivery .
Simply awesome,"This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone. Best features with stunning looks & performance. Battery life is very good..."
Wonderful,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.
Classy product,This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I‚Äôve been a long time android user in between. I‚Äôll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn‚Äôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ...
Love at First Home Touch,"Totally worth the price if:- you are a iOS fan- like compact phone- want to switch from android to iPhone- you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)- you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)- you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (yo..."
Worth the money,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it‚Äôs worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating
Mind-blowing purchase,"This is a beast. Smaller yet powerful. Sleek design and a Beauty.I will give straight reason for:Why to buy?1. If you want an iPhone2. If this is your first one3. If you want a small screen phone just for working purpose no entertainment4. If you have another phone as backup5. If you have other apple products and you want to pair this up as your latest purchase.6. If you have a decent 42k to spend without any second thought.Why not to buy?1. Battery drain, and low battery capacity..."
Iphone SE Budgeted Phone of 2020?,"I have Purchased The new Iphone SE 2020 on 20th May 2020, So based on my usage for a week I can rate the product as follows* Pros: 1) Display quality seems to be very good.              2) Camera quality is excellent , takes a very sharp images without any blurriness.              3) Touch sensor works very precisely              4) Durability of the phone is good as the quality of body is made of 6000K aluminum which is one of the most durable aluminum in the mobile-industry           ..."
Very Good,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good. The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."
Brilliant,"People talk about it‚Äôs battery backup?? man I‚Äôm in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you‚Äôve used both you‚Äôll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I‚Äôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece."
Just wow!,"iPhone SE 2020 Looks premiumüòç Battery:-Most of the people think it‚Äôs only 1800 mAh battery???? Is it sufficient??üßêAfter 8 days of usage ..! in 100%chargeI have played lots of game especially pubg3Hrs of pubg with fully charge6Hrs of Heavy usages also played 1Hrs of pubg14Hrs with normal usage like .,movie,what app,Fb,Instagram and Twitter and callCharging time:- takes more than 2.5hrs with box charger and with 12w 1.50Hrs Performance:- Same like iPhone 11,11pro,11pro max (A13bionic..."
Wonderful,"Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you..."
Value-for-money,"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest."
Highly recommended,best compact phone i ever have.It has pretty good camera and performance.I have iphone 11pro but now i fall in love with this phone.Best phoneüëçüëç.Go for it if u love small size phoneüëçüëçüëç
Super!,"My first iPhone and very happy with it. Slick and gorgeous design with perfect compact mobile. Performance is so amazing ,display softness more than 5 *. Little bit battery issues for fast drains like need to charge once in a 12 hours. May be this will solve out in next update. Definitely worth to buy than other brands."
Best in the market!,"One word.. beautiful iphone ‚ù§Ô∏è premium feelJust go for it without any doubt. Superb camera, handy, white color is soo good. This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."
Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ..."
Value-for-money,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it‚Äôs worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating
Perfect product!,"The powerful small phone that I always wished for !!Nowadays the fad is big screen phones but for me, I like a small powerful phone with awesome camera. Ticked all the boxes that I had in my mind. Switched from android. Never going back!"
Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins. Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins. Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn‚Äôt look nice to me.
Super!,"After using this Device as my daily driver for over a month i can say that , It‚Äôs inbuilt AI and Machine Learning is so good that it manages all my things by itself, and even after having a small battery of 1800 MAH, it performs all day with some juice left, which is impressive. Awesome Camera, amazing Performance thanks to A13 Bionic. Suggestion go for 128GB it will help you in long run. Overall a very good and nice product."
Classy product,"First of all we will talk about battery it has 1800 mah battery ,but u know what it works like 4000 mah truly amazing phone with optical image stabilisation in video with editing option 64 gb variant is too good go for it"
Best in the market!,"As being a frequent apple user, I couldn't find much of a difference when comparing to IPhone 6.The size and display are the same of IPhone 6 and ofcourse there is 0 negative comments for the A13 chip. It is super fast‚úåÔ∏è.Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.No negative comments for the camera, apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights, a front facing portrait camera, a wider photo fr..."
Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with..."
Terrific,"This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable.  The camera is better in every way. The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame/sec super slow motion recording. Performance is way too better than android. This is fast, very very fast. If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok. In fact this is the only issue with this phone. This one fits in my ..."
Perfect product!,Finally most awaited first iPhone came within 3 days of order iPhone SE in one line A powerful performance in compact design and affordable ratesFirst iPhone in life where you compare each and every functionality with your previous android phone.Pros * Powerful chip at affordable price * Suitable who want to back to having experience of compact screen phone without bazzels.* Powerful camera experience with A13 Bionic chip image processing power* My personally favourite I always pref...

Awesome,"Brilliant performance everything is best if you compatible with small screen but battery is average , premium looks sound quality awesome handy phone camera quality ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èThanks flipkart."
Does the job,"Writing this review after around 1 week of use.Updating this review after a further 2 weeks of use.Initially, there was some heating on the phone, but on further use that problem has disappeared. Got to explore the camera a bit more and found it to be very good, the stability on the video is also good.Pros -      1. Good Camera Quality. Image quality is very good. Pictures are sharp. Good performance in bokeh mode.      2. Good performance. The phone has no lags so far, it is very smoo..."
Go for it without any hesitation.,"Honest advice  :  Don't watch any tech reviewer's videos before buying this beast.I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.2. if you are switching from ~6"" screen , it is going to be troublesome for a while.3. 1821  mah battery . 0 to 100% charging time is around 130 minutes. Fast charging/wireless charging is supported but fast charger is not included in box.4. Gaming Experience is amazing BUT p..."
Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."
Very Good,Got it yesterday 11 June ordered on 30may seller shipped on 7 June What‚Äôs happening Flipkart ? Coming to the phone. I switched from my old Se .CAMERA: it‚Äôs just Awesome in every way but those portraits lighting effects are of no use obviously mostly they won‚Äôt be used by anyone BATTERY: it‚Äôs just average it only remains for 6 to 8 hours of moderate usage DISPLAY: coming from four inch screen to 4.7 I feel like it‚Äôs huge and fair enough ( I always prefer compact phones ) Touch ID : it‚Äôs...
Awesome,"I jumped from old SE to the new SE.the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm. The highlight of this product is it‚Äôs elegance and sleek design. Looks so good in white colour. Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU. If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it. But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed, CAMERA, looks, iOS ecosystem and longevity of this devic..."
Good phone for the price,"Some might say overpriced in India, but below are the PROS and CONS after 3 days of usage:Pros:1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.2. Very good single camera for daylight photography. Night time is good but not great.3. Optimal screen size for a phone for one hand use.4. Brilliant looks5. Battery life is one day when used like a phone. Watch various youtube videos to increase battery life. Optimal use of battery saver mode and screen brightness can..."
Highly recommended,"iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof..Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it.It is good for email surfing, browsing, couple of videos per day.Camera quality is not superb but good in day lightVideo is extraordinary i can sayPerformance speed is tremendousBattery approx 1800mah is equivalent to 4000mah of other brands.White color stand unique in crowd.. because black color become traditional for all mobile handsets..Can go..."
Excellent,"Mini Black BeastWho likes handy best option with solid device and super fast performanceBattery stands for 4 to 5 hrs.Over all satisfied as a first time iPhone userFavourites in this device speed,ui, camera portrait image features, mini device with solid build."
Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it. Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn‚Äôt matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one a..."
Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace. The only small minus point is battery. A but as i am a moderate user its perfectly fine for me. Great product as usual from apple.üôåüèª
Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don‚Äôt like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."
Value-for-money,"USP:1. Compact mobile which i always wanted in iPhone models2. Kickass A13 bionic chip , one of the best energy efficient apple processor produced till date.3. Camera is awesome to take pics (only day time) 4K videos 30/60 fps.Downside:1. Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.Note: i would not advice this compact super mobile for people who are always glued to social media and YouTube.This is for someone who w..."

Simply awesome,I really love to use iosüòç..Apple is my Favourite brand üî•... I really love this phone. It was easy to hold and It was very fast processing mobile. In Future I will always purchase Apple mobileüòç Thank You Apple and Flipkart.
Mind-blowing purchase,Kind of camera in this price range  is amazing ... as the user interface is amazingly convenient ... no wonder why after getting an iphone ppl take a step forward for other accessories ...... worth of buying at this price range
Good,Very good phone for regular usage camera is outstanding with A13 boinic chip. Value for money set. Battery is not that much perfect but over all a good and handy smartphone i had ever seen.

Best in the market!,"It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it, the camera is a beast, the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use, if ur a heavy user you'd need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get rlly good gameplay, worth the money, btw if ur coming for a larger screen, you might feel it's a lil too small but honestly it's not rlly that small, so buy it, it's perfect."
Value-for-money,Battery will give good performance for a normal userI suggest another variant for heavy usersCam quality is good in day light conditions Performance is very good with A13 Bionic chipSmall in size and don‚Äôt expect a screen size like MI or one plus full screen mobiles
Highly recommended,Each and every Paisa you is worthyCamera section is a great upgrade Performance is a beastIt‚Äôs just a old design but still amazing design to hold in hand.I upgraded from old SE and satisfied to the core
Brilliant,So fast as light  classy premium look  at affordable price thank you flipkart for easy delivery
Highly recommended,Loved it!12 MP single camera does its job better than many flagship camera phones. Very compact and perfect for single hand use. Battery lasts at least one day for a normal use.
Fair,"Pros :-1. A-13 Bionic Chip....Beast in performance2. Best video camera phone under 50K3. Easy to hold, carry and one handed use4. RAM management is excellent5. Rear camera is good6. Output from speekers are too goodCons :-1. Worst battery performance...4 hours hardly on a single charge2. Still you get 5W charger in the box... While phone's cost around 42.5k...but phone does support 18w fast charging..3. No night mode available4. Design is too old5. Frot camera is not up to the ..."
Must buy!,Best camera phone Image processing is best Best display and battery life is also best Best processor Overall best phone U can look after images also
Nice product,"It‚Äôs a beast in performance, only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn‚Äôt break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I‚Äôve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if..."
Perfect product!,"Speed is Awesome , high quality Camera with portrait mode , more handy than big screen mobiles, Premium look & design , sound quality is boom , very happy After purchase this"
Perfect product!,"This Phone is Simply Brilliant.The fastest mobile processor from Apple, A13 bionic chip can tackle any task without breaking a sweat. The CLASSIC Design is the reason to buy this phone as it is so easy for one hand operation. Camera performance and Battery backup has been improved significantly over the predecessor. Definetely a Value for your Buck."
Worth every penny,Best model if you wish to enter the Apple ecosystem. Flawless product and seamless experience. I love this phone.
Best in the market!,"Hey iPhone lovers. If you like small phone you'll love it. A13 performed like a beast. Performance is top notch. If your budget tight, then go for it. You never disappoint after use it. And Apple iPhone security is best."
Terrible product,It‚Äôs not good product ...it‚Äôs cost is more quality is not good every time is hangout..battery consumption is more at least half day also not get in ...finally my best suggestion is choose another one...
Terrific purchase,Excellent phone from Apple... Almost same like iPhone 7 and 8 with latest processor. I can feel the speed very much compared to the iPhone 6s. It‚Äôs awesome budget phone from iPhone family.
Simply awesome,It's a good phone for who like handy phones. But when its come to battery backup it's a worst thing. Performance of the phone is good
Pretty good,The phone is amazing according to me.. just some cons r the battery life and the big bezels .. the small phone is all I needed .. and it feels so much secure in one hand.. i needed exactly this type of phone which i can use one handed and have the beast like performance.. previously i was using a 5 inch phone Nokia 3 so the shift according to size is giving the same feel.. one thing that bothering me is the keyboard‚Ä¶ even its approx the same size phone but keyboard is too tight to type.. it w...
Wonderful,"Performance is top notch, battery is full day easily after disabling background app Refresh ( it doesn‚Äôt effect any functionality) and some other tweaks. Camera is fantastic overall value for money if you get this in offer."
Very Good,"Amazing phone, loved it, only issue is gets hot too much and too early. Otherwise a very good buy"
Worth every penny,Amazing phone with beast performance and super value for money if you wanna be in apple eco system this is great device for you.
Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."
Brilliant,For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean  top notch performance ......FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch . Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing. Switch off optimised battery charging under battery health settings so 80-100% will b charged quickly.I use social media apps l...
Great product,"Excellent phone , flawless performance The massive upgrade for the user who are using the iphone SE ( 1 gen) just like me"
Wonderful,"Well, the phone is small and looks nice. It's not for people who loves bigger ones. It's basically for those people who don't use their phones for everything.It's fast.design is cool, sleek and beautiful. You will need a back cover for sure if you want to keep up it's beauty. P:)battery life - not so good. voice clarity is fine.I am not a gamer neither a photographer.Basically it;s a premium phone under budget so that you can say it loud - "" Hey! I own an Apple device"". If somebody is ..."
Wonderful,"Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation."
Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.P.S.- it's not that small."
Just wow!,"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand. I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and it‚Äôs just great. I am a big fan of iOS and I‚Äôm deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and I‚Äôm not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically ..."
Good choice,"ProsClassy performance , sensitive touch , good sound quality , beautiful design , compact and comfortable,Good quality Camera, Battery backup is normal.ConsPhone is overheating this is something not expected from APPLE Bit disappointing.Selfi photo click flips automatically so sometimes photos are weird. Wish there is a setting not to flip before foto click."
Great product,Honestly best package from apple. Super handy. I don't like big phones. This phone is perfect for me and would definately recommend to everybody. If you compare antutu and geekbench scores with of iphone 11; this easily beats the iphone 11.
Good choice,SE IS GOOD MOBILE and camera result is best my first apple mobile but very good like better android and other device. U have apple so don‚Äôt need to camera
Great product,13 MP Back Camera More Better than 64mp camera phone's and 7MP Front Camera Same as that.1845 Mah Batter then any other 5000 mah Smartphones Batterymost precious part The Bionic13 Chipset in this price range just Awesome

Excellent,"Wanted a small iPhone with home button specifically,, this isn‚Äôt small at all!! Great handy phone with amazing camera settings.. Thank you Steve!!"
Good quality product,"The Phone makes it a good compact phone to kick start you ios Experience. This being my second iphone after the 6S+ and this phone just being my secondary phone it has the solid reliability which i want. The battery standby is good but if a person in considering to use this phone as a primary device the battery wont last for the full day sadly. The performance is brilliant, no lags in the phone and camera is pretty solid in 2021 and can definitely see the camera hold up pretty good for anothe..."
Must buy!,"Trust me its best phone under 30k or 40k , i bought it for 25k and i am sooo happy with it."
Very Good,Canara quality is good Performance is awesome Excellent for gaming but small screen And battery performance is not much good Totally product is nice I loved it ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòç
Fabulous!,"Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11."
Perfecto !,"1 Week after using the phone I am Simply Loving it!I did a lot of research and was confused in Iphone XR, SE 2020 and One plus 8If you are Ok with older design/big bezels or looking for GREAT Camera in budget phone or moving from Android to IOS, this phone is best for you.Camera(Portrait in selfie mode), Build quality, A13 Bionic Chip, Compact design, latest OS(software support for at least 4 years) is simply Bang On!Downs :Night mode Camera quality is not good.Battery is not the best..."
Great product,"Writing this review after almost 3 months of usage. This is my first iPhone I got this delivered on 1st October 2021. The packaging was good. Coming to the device, I‚Äôm currently running iOS 15.2PROS :1) Superb build quality 2) Touch ID is blazing fast 3) Camera is very good, especially for videos4) Signal reception very good5) Earpiece volume for call is one of the loudest I have seen 6) Wi-Fi calling support with Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea (Tried in Mumbai and Maharashtra circl..."
Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
Good quality product,First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It‚Äôs been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions. Pros:Fits in the budget.Handy device.Camera and display are awesome.Good network connectivity.Latest iOS update.Great build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )Performance is great.Can handle almost everything.And yes it‚Äôs an iPhone!Co...
Simply awesome,"Breathtaking. Smooth Performance. Amazing Camera and video performance. Dual Sim. Smooth Networks. Ideal for first time Android users, who are doing the switch. Battery Backup is decent. Will last for a day, for a moderate user. Buy it for the A13 Bionic. You won't regret."
Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
Classy product,It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!
Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen s..."
Super!,"First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.Camera is too good in light, I mean best, but don‚Äôt expect great pics in night. Battery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess v..."
Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it‚Äôs not th..."
Wonderful,"Awesome. As always its iPhone all the way,be it ip13 or SE2. The name says it all. Smooth like a butter. No lag whatsoever. Proud to own a new iPhone at the price of refurbished ones. Wow. Thanks Flipkart! You did it. Camera is awesome, even in pitch darkness. The only Con is battery which is way too less in capacity and duration. But, hey, that‚Äôs also the plus point here. You can charge it fast to fill using 15w charger. Support to wireless charging is the icing on the cake, despite a bit to..."
Brilliant,"I was aware of that this is a fantastic phone except the battary life before purchase. But I have specific use case as follows 1. I use it as business phone with lots of phone calls during a day. 2. I do not have social media presence. Even the whatsapp is not installed. (I have whatsapp on second phone which I keep it at home and it works on home wifi). I only use imessage for close family members.3. It has all my business outlook email, calender, notes, Gmail is configured to inbuilt app..."
Great product,Best product but apple could have launched it in very less price.Screensjze comparatively smallBeterry performance satisfactory Camera extra ordinarily Sensors and apps way fast and results jn blink Buy if price around 25 max
Terrific purchase,"Fantastic phone, in a beautiful form factor, handy, ergonomic and power packed device. Please do not go by the reviews of ""PUBG chipmunks"", who are looking for a device for gaming purposes. This is the perfect phone for no non sense every day users, who would like to make calls,browse the internet, use mail clients and do social networking."
Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using iphones for a long time iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s , So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.I am not comfortable with Face ID .The Phone Size seems small but for someone used to iphone 6S, it seems the same !!Don't want to admit this but well, I would have loved to get iphone 11 but then 20k i..."
Pretty good,"Well what can u expect from a 30k iPhone. Normal battery, nice camera but don‚Äôt go for se if you‚Äôre just going for camera cuz even if it performs well, you‚Äôll see how it fares in low light and the front camera oh the front camera. It‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs not good either. Or is it just me? Cuz I see mine a lil bit grainy and not like super clear. I know it‚Äôs just 7mp but well. I compared it with an 11 and a 12. Let‚Äôs just say big bros gave it a beating. Overall good phone. But small screen and b..."
Really Nice,"Great performance, battery life is good for compatible users who doesn‚Äôt play more games, Good display, handy phone to carry easily... loved itü§çüñ§"
Great product,"One word, Outstanding!I‚Äôve Samsung galaxy A70 and I turned off many of its services including animations so that it give me a all day battery life but this is not the case with this iPhone SE .It comes with just 1821 mah battery but trust me It gives 24hr battery backup which includes 4.5hr on screen time. Mostly I use my phone for WhatsApp, insta, news articles, YouTube music and puzzle games when I got time.It‚Äôs display is good, looks like OLED one (but it is not)."
Simply awesome,"Really happy with this device, have come from an iPhone 5S so a significant upgrade in features/performance etc. It might be a little small for some but it ...Excellent Phone at a Great Price - But With Some Shortcomings..."
Delightful,Firstly i got this phone for 24.5k so i would say it was a good bargain for me to get my first iphone . Keeping this price in kind the performance of this phone is just awesome . I am not much of a person who consumes lot of video content for me its a device which does its jobs very nicely . Battery is bad for any average user but since i use it mostly for calls texts and some banking apps it serves the purpose. This phone is for people who dont much of their time on phone and want a compact ...
Really Nice,This is beautiful device which contain iconic A13 bionic chip. Chip makes this little device beast. I also enjoy six months Apple Music and Apple TV one year subscription free.Pocket friendly device both in terms of money and size.
Simply awesome,"Best compact phone ,camera is excellent Battery is average Display is very nice Performance is a power houseüî•üî•üî•"
Nice,"It's not the phone that has an issue, it's flipkart. I ordered this phone on 31st of July and promised date was 4th August. But I got the phone on 6th August. Doesn't sound like much of a delay but it becomes a lot when u have a flight coming close and flipkart says your product will be delivered before 10th August. Like I could see clearly the phone is close to me (has reached my nearest hub). Now coming to the phone the display could've been better considering the price, but it's not a bumm..."
Fabulous!,"Was never a great birthday gift for spouse. Power pack device. A13 brings life to whole performance. Except screen size and camera, performance wise it's a comparable and affordable device in comparison with 11 pro. Camera too works way better than comparable 12MP devices.  Battery lasts full day for normal usage including couple hours of youtube videos. Great work Apple."
Really Nice,"Marking the return of the phone with great performance in a small form factor, this one does make it easy to love it.A well priced proposition with bang for the buck performance and the iOS level of confidence.The battery is only average but that can also be improved if you are a little more aware, than the commonwealth, of the system software customisations.All in all a good phone with a great performance and a decent battery life."
Must buy!,"A device that will last for atleast 5 years with the latest softwares at your disposal. A camera you can always trust about its consistency. Very compact . Battery is good, no matter what people say, if you are not gaming or not shooting videos for hours and hours, battery is solid with exceptional standby. Last but not the least, Flipkart was amazing with its services. At every stage. Thank you"
Fabulous!,"This phone is superb !!! At this budget it is very valuable. The camera,battery,display and sound everything is 100% for this budget. I am very happy with this phone. I have used it 2 months and I haven‚Äôt face any problem. I love it!!!"
Must buy!,"The iPhone se was good but battery could not survive a day, if u r a Android user then I would suggest Mi11x and if u want to try iPhone then u can, but battery life is very important and also have to buy a fast charger seperately can't count the flaws of this device as it is the cheapest iPhone"
Classy product,"The best budget iPhone you can get. The camera: great for daylight images, only downside I would say is the lack of night sight, but yeah it does the task. Performance: I will certainly be joking if I said I was experiencing issues with the phone‚Äôs performance. It‚Äôs A13 for god‚Äôs sake. The best processor in the market right now and I feel this is the reason most of us are buying. This phone is gonna last you more than any android in the same price segment will ever do. And that includes One..."
Terrific,The phone is working awesome high speed the only demerit is size if you are okay with the size then you can buy the phone without even reading anything amazing built quality thankyou apple and flipkart the battery is awesome and everything is fine with the phone no problem faced till now
Good quality product,"iOS is always great for it's fluid and great performance, this phone is no different from that as A13 chip took it to next level.Cons: Battery could have been better due to increasing dependency on mobiles and apps in this digitized world."
Terrific,"If you don't know the benefits of the Apple ecosystem, this is the phone to introduce you to it and if you use it properly, you will never go backIt's (comparatively) reasonably priced. In fact given it's processor which is the same as one in iPhone Pro which costs more than a lakh plus Apples' updates thay go on for 5-6 years, it's probably better value than most ""cheaper"" phones out there.The camera is great and Touch ID in this age of mask wearing is perfect. Cons - battery isn't as ..."
Worth the money,"First iPhone as per my budget, thanks to Flipkart for providing it in a discount price. Purchased it for the strong privacy features of an iOS.Reviewing after 5 days of use,Battery: Need to use very sincerely or use 20w adapter for 100% charge in 1 hour.Camera: GoodPerformance: Very good, 1 app to another app opening performance very smooth.Size: awesome, It's very handy to use by one palm and fingers only.Keyboard: After using 6inch Android smartphone its takes time to input the da..."
Classy product,This is truly fab phone .it is very handy üòÄ Camera is superb  sound is great. Smooth performance. Se 2020 is my first iPhone  I really love this phone .
Value-for-money,"This is one of the best mobile. Since I‚Äôm using this phone from last 24 hours and I personally feel that it‚Äôs a complete packet. It contains everything, yes its display is bit smaller but you don‚Äôt feel if you are comfortable with small phones. The A13 chip set is playing its best role. I personally feel that it‚Äôs good for normal person. Not for heavy gamers."
Worth the money,"After one month of use  finding it very nice and good product.exploring new features of ios 14 every day.the photos and selfies are awesome even with a single camera. In short any anyone who wishes to have a  power packed, sturdy ,reliable and "" Virus free"" long lasting  phone. Iphone SE 2020 is a better alternative ."
Super!,"If battery will be ok, the entireIndia will buy this se 2020. All other brand will be failled in India and other parts of world.As a senior citizen I feel it is easy to handle, waitless andI proud to have a super engine."

It's really very very appreciable work done to Apple.I am very happy to this product &this is my observation that this product is called value of money.."
Excellent Specs Let Down/Throttled Only By Battery Life!,"I have been using the SE for a good 12-13 days now, have tried gaming but i won't recommend buying this phone for power and gaming as that would drain the battery faster. The primary reason i went with the SE is the form factor and smaller screen, I wanted to cut down on my digital consumption and this has helped me do that.Pros:Super FastTaptic Engine is amazingVery Decent CameraGreat Build qualityEntry into Ios ecosystemSolid 5 years SupportCons:No night modeAverage batteryFor..."
Fabulous!,I ordered the Red colored iPhone SE on 2-Jun. Flipkart gave date of delivery on 7-Jun but due to lockdown it got delayed by 3 days and I received on 10-Jun. Good effort by Flipkart during such challenging times.The looks and feel of the phone is a class apart compared to other Android phones I have used in the past. The colour is awesome and hard to take your eyes off. The Product RED written at the back adds to its esthetic.It is easier on the grip being smaller and even with a back cove...
Classy product,Very cute phone and performance upto the standards of an Apple product. Great value for money but may not be liked by those who watch videos and do gaming with current day larger display phones. A great product all in all.
Delightful,Battery sucks. It lasted 100% for 2 months then 99-96 in just one monthOther things are greatGreat camera great processor great screen and handy phone But there is not that much battery to enjoy it‚Äôs features
Simply awesome,"Best budget iphone you could buy, i really recommend to those who are Android users and doesn't want to spend much but still want to experience Iphone. Go for it. yeah people will say its battery is bad. If you are using it for long it definitly will not last long. But if you use it as secondary phone its a good chooice."
Perfect product!,"I find it best phone in this size and price category. Display, camera, speed all is good, battery life may not look good if you are an extensive user of phone. On an average 2-3 hours of daily screen time, battery lasts for 2 days in one full charge, which is good enough for me. This size of phone gives comfortable feeling n grip in hand so i find it best."
Excellent,"Shooting in 4K is like very cinematic. I get a screen time of 6 hours. I use Instagram, some trading apps and switching on hotspot gives a decent battery. Just go for it if you want to buy. Add on 20W charger to your cart. It charges 50% in 30 min.. Super cool to use this little monster.."
Brilliant,"I bought the phone on the sale at the best price. This phone is really a flagship phone it has all good features of all the earlier models iPhone 6,7 & 8. Pros1. The phone size is 4.7‚Äù which is very good, better than the other mammoth.2. Battery backup is adequate one can get a days backup easily with average usage.3.

Good quality product,genuine product.
Mind-blowing purchase,"If you are looking for a compact phone without compromising on performance and a fluid ux design, then you are going to love it. If you are also switching to Apple ecosystem from Android and want to go easy on your pocket, then this is one of the best choice.Having said that you might miss dual sim slot, it comes with just one. No 3.5 mm Jack for your headphones, but then you don‚Äôt get it with any Apple products these days. Camera department could‚Äôve done better in low light photography. Ov..."
Pretty good,"Great phone. Tough to find such compact phones in the android world. If only Apple had given a charger and earphones, it'd have been awesome. Battery life is fine but not that great. Rest everything is 10 on 10"
Does the job,Only good not best
Pretty good,Okey
Classy product,Quality of apple feels in hand properly distinct from other smartphones . Also very fast Hats off to A13 Bionic .
Really Nice,"Got this within 24 hours, thanks flipkart.Product red is awesome and shiny.Pros :1) Easy handling and 2) Easy data migration from Android to IOS using move to its app3) performance  is top notch with A13 bionic chips etc similar to iPhone 11. 4) Display is awesome5) awesome phone for 29kCons1) No power adaptor or headphones you have to buy it separately.  Adaptor alone is close to 2k"
Awesome,Amazing phone with an awesome offer
Worthless,Not given charger
Worth every penny,This phone is a jewel phone. It‚Äôs kind of feels premium to me.
Terrible product,"Battery strength is very bad... Hardly its working 12hrs after 100% charged, with very basic uses of phone.thinking to return it."
Expected a better product,Gets too hot when charging
Perfect product!,It‚Äôs really good for those who are using first apple phone
Did not meet expectations,Very bad shopping experience with Flipkart
Just okay,"During app calls, especially through WhatsApp,  for 1hour22mins it goes down from 100% to 58% literally.I've turned off the following 1)background internet usage of app, 2)auto brightness is off, 3)screen time is off, 4)auto lock set in 30 seconds,5)No gaming at all, not a single time, after all this that is what I've got as a result.If you don't touch the phone after 100%, it stays at 98% after 24hours.This is where it sucks alot, aka battery, all good features against this dropback..."

Just wow!,"Keeping it shortBest value for money, capeesh. Has its shortcomings battery(will get you 3.5 - 5.5 hours of screen on time depending on the usage, gaming is wonderful but due to its small battery capacity it does depletes fast, roughly around 2 - 2.5 hours on screen time) and camera(night mode doesn‚Äôt support, although Apple can add it through software on due to its processing power but lack in a second camera don‚Äôt let it do so). Other then that trust me you will enjoy it and get its money‚Äô..."
Perfect product!,"The phone is all over amazing best for entering ios ecosystem the screen size is not as small as it may seem , the only problem i faced was battery life it could have been better but the powerful processor does demand a lot of battery , the images are unbeatable even by Android flagships"

Worth every penny,This is my first iphone.. and I really thanks to Flipkart because of the product is very very good not any problem..I really like iPhone se 128 gb white colour is so good looking
Perfect product!,"This is my second iPhone and it‚Äôs pretty good, the performance is fast and never felt a lag. For my day-to-day usage it‚Äôs perfect, I have no complaints with the battery. The compact size makes it easier to use and for this budget it‚Äôs worth to go for unless want to shell out 2x the amount for 12 mini, which is a bit smaller than SE 2nd Generation; has better camera setup; better screen & better battery life."

Terrific,I switched to iphone from android its an very good option. Ios is just awsome. And size of SE is very compact. For i feel like screen size is little bit small but after use of 2 days its very nice experience. iPhone just nailed it.
Mind-blowing purchase,"Just bought this phone a week ago. Already loving the performance,camera.Also my usage is not much (no games)and the battery easily lasts for about 10 to 11 hoursAnyone who loves compact phone you should go for this phone"
Terrific purchase,"Writing this review post 3 months of usage.For normal user and daily tasks battery is decent and will work from morning full to evening.One who is looking for compact phone and moving to iPhone , this is a good choice. For high usage people and gaming, not at all recommended because of smaller battery and screen size."
Perfect product!,Not just the best value for money iPhone but the best value for money phone. Got it for 30k. Best phone if you are a light user.
Awesome,I'm loving this beast‚ù§. Excellent performance and excellent camera. Battery is fine enough. One of the best phone in this range.
Does the job,"I have found stutters while using mobile even if simple web surfing rarely.Heats alot while charging and during camera on for 10 to 15minutesBuild and looks are CLASSY.Features and automation are SUPER COOL on this mobile.This phone as has both plus and minuses, i luvd this mobile‚Äôs luk and pretty happy with itüòÅ"
Wonderful,Everything seems fine with this phone but this is a super fast car but with a small gas tank the one and only con of this phone but if you are looking to buy this phone you know what you have signed up for but if you want to get a scoop of ios for the first this will be a perfect device to start with as it comes with the one of the best processor at an reasonable price tag my suggestion is that if you can compromise by charging your phone for 2 times a day you can easily go for it
Very Good,Overall the phone is very good but the fact is that it is too small in comparison to phones now these days however the camera is very good and the processor is very powerful you can play any game in the in it. You should not consider buying this. Only con is that it is screen sizes too small.
Really Nice,Product is very good and a very good value for money. Just loving it the most. One of the best phones for this price.
Excellent,"Worth buying. I bought for 37000 that to on installments. 4K recording is awesome and camera is excellent, sleek, beautifully designed, battery is being improved a lot.A great package, those want handy phone se2 is perfect for them. Used quite brands but the quality of photos and video on iPhone is exactly what we see or click or shoot."
Does the job,"This phone fells like alto car with SUV engine. If you fill it full and go for a ride, it would get empty the moment you start to enjoy the ride. Not worth the money."

Quick Powerful and Handy,"It is quick, powerful and handy.Pocket friendly (In terms of both Size and Money :)) The only drawback would be if you are used to larger screen the video and contents appear smaller to you and will see the difference.Smart delivery by Flipkart"
Wonderful,iPhone user since 5 years.Performance wise very nice phone and sufficient as per my basic requirement.Secured device as compare to Android and compatible and very handy.Bit disappoint in terms of battery performance.12MP camera is fine for phone purpose.
Great product,This is my first iPhone and I am pretty happy with the device. Everything is okay with the phone but it would be much more better if it came with a bigger display and a higher mah battery
Highly recommended,"It cant get any better. For people who like compact phones like 6,6s, nd 7 this is the real deal and way cheaper. My last phone was iphone 7 for 60k back in 2016 nd this is next generation 7 at just 38,900Just amazing.. Performance is outstanding.."
Perfect product!,"this phone is great,  if someone like small size phone then its great product for him.performance is awesome really loved this apple product and also budget phone by apple."
Very Good,"Awesome phone the only drawback is its battery life, did not last entire day even with moderate usage. Camera is amazing and A13 is awesome, lighting fast phone with decent screensize. Not recommended for gamers, professionals and moderate users should go for it."
Excellent,"there,s nothing fancy in this phone, it,s simple and i love it... if you like compact and doesnt care much about battery, then go for it, A13 bionic chipset is waiting for you.it,s not phone for everyone, but if you regret after buying it, it will show that you haven't researched about the phone.."
Wonderful,"Absolute beast of a phone - compact, portable and with an amazing camera paired to stereo speakers! Battery life is sadly the major drawback of this phone and so not recommended for people who expect higher screen on time. I find it suitable for our mothers and fathers who want something portable and easy to use from day one! I also found outdoor brightness of the screen underwhelming, struggling to read outdoors. But the phone makes up for its drawbacks for features such as: water and dust r..."
A Super Affordable Smart Phone !!,"A perfect blend of nostalgia, perfect size and ergonomics combined with super top of the line specs but with some back dates stuff !Overall, a value for money Apple phone which will last you another 3-4 years, maybe more and will never let you down.

I purchased this phone for my mom, basically she needed a compact phone and who would have thought it would be an iphone.Yes I do believe price is currently on higher side in india as compared to global market.

Pretty good,Phone is good if ypu wish t ahift drom android and want a decent camera in your pocket. Defenetly not for gamers because processor Bionic A13 can take nay game with full graphics no prob but battery will disappoint you. Not for long video calls rest things are fine premium feel full display could have been better. If battery and display is also important ro you consider XR or 11.
Delightful,"Package is well packed . Got this phone in first sale itself and it's been 3 weeks . Performance is snappy and camera is pretty good. The only con is Battery life which barely lasts full day with moderate to heavy usage, but it is expected because of it's compact and light weight design. Other than that phone is good and price should be at least 10k cheaper then only price to performance ratio can be justified"
Terrific purchase,I love this product and thanks to flipkart for a quick delivery that I didn‚Äôt expect that I got it before the delivery date that mention in the order list and i thank you to the delivery man that he took patience to wait till I paid the bill for this order. Once again thank you so much.
Good quality product,iPhone SE here in 2020 boom it‚Äôs powerful device low budget iPhone ever don‚Äôt go on price phone is packed with performance running on A13 Chip which makes apps run butter smooth camera is good borrowed from IPhone 11 battery is smaller bcoz of the size of phone but does your job speaker is quite loud every phone has pros and cons so we have to deal with it overall it‚Äôs good phone under budget go for it all three colour are amazing I have bought white
Slightly disappointed,"PHONE stopped working as it was draining battery due to network issue, it looses signal frequently. Phone dead after 1 yr 6 months"
Pretty good,"The phone works just fine! Despite the negativity around the battery life (which is true, only if you want to want to play games).Camera is nice, display with True Tone feels just right and the performance is spectacular! After 3 years with Android (Google Pixel 2 XL) it was time to head back to iOS. Nothing against Android, that was a brilliant phone too, but too big for me. (Personal choice). I don‚Äôt play games or watch movies/videos for prolonged duration. So a big screen just felt like ..."
Terrific,Performance is awesome with A13 bionic chipThose who capture a lot of pics it‚Äôs a very good choice fir them... single camera but picture quality is giant....Battery performance is little bit of weak.. doesn‚Äôt looks good.. for normal use it‚Äôs ok.. but those who are heavy user for them doesn‚Äôt look good....Very handy phone with a premium look... but the bazzels one the screen looks old.. but overall it‚Äôs good to buy within this price range
Value-for-money,This phone is meant for niche market. Not for people who like screen size more than 5.5 or 6 inch. Was waiting for a product like this since long and now will experience this with the latest A13 bionic chip. Great buy for people who require smaller handy phones. Not for gaming purpose of course. You can buy a play station instead üòâ. Regards
Worth every penny,Super compact fone for no nonsense users!!! Good speaker quality & super fast due to A13 buonic chip.
Mind-blowing purchase,"I just love this phone. This is my first iPhone and it is handy, fast and beautiful. This is great power in small package. It is working absolutely great."
Perfect product!,This iphone totally worth it. I call it a Mini iphone 11. I suggest this to those who are 1. looking to buy apple product for the first time. 2. Looking for a phone that is compact but with full features of flagship. 3. Although it is good for gaming but I will not recommend you to consider it for gaming.Only concern:- battery capacity is not that great but if you do moderate use with social media and bit of youtube streaming.It lasts for a day. 11-12 hours outside.
Awesome,Bought and used this device for 24 hours. This is pretty good bargain for People who do phone calls and watch few videos. Battery holds good for a day if you don‚Äôt push it. Don‚Äôt fall for the battery drain and charge testing videos. Use a Samsung charger. It charges fast while not heating the phone.Camera is awesome and you don‚Äôt have to be a pro to click some brilliant pictures and videos. You want an iPhone then go for it.
Mind-blowing purchase,The Apple IPhone SE has been an all time favorite for the family members due to its size and quality. I have been using the old model of SE from 2014 and now changed to 2020 SE model due to its quality and reliability. The phone is very much handy for small size hands and also have bigger screen than earlier version. The sound quality is improved by it's stereo speakers. The quality of camera is also enhanced for great pictures for life time experience. It came in different colors with sleek ...
Must buy!,"Just an amazing phone, the interface is great there is no lag, the battery backup is also decent, and the camera quality is amazing the phone feels really premium and high quality, best choice go for it. Try buying the one with the charger and the earpods to save money"
Classy product,"Honest Review after using for around 3 months and still using it as primary mobile.Pros. Amazing CameraSpeaker is just too good.The fluidic interface of apple which feels so smooth while using it.The earphones given along with mobile phone in-box is just superb. Cons.1. Screen size is bit small. You get used to it with time but when it feels awkward when you suddenly switch from some big screen phone to this.2. Battery life is not too great. Although with normal usage, my phone lasts ..."
Simply awesome,"After using for a week, this phone is working really upto expectation. Bought in 33K for 128gb variant along with charger and earpods. If you want a powerful chip along with large storage space and also a touch of apple, then this is the phone. PS: Black looks amazing and classy when comes to Iphone"
Wonderful,"I bought this mobile as a replacement for my mother's age old iphone 5S, as she was stuck with IOS & single home button. I'm really surprised with its great performance and features. Felt like buying it for myself too. But its battery is not so great for working people. To sum it up, very good mobile for this price bracket."
Nice product,"Battery backup is good, using it for last 2 weeks and it works for 24 hours for me in moderate usage. Camera is better than most of high end Android phones. I dint like notch display thus went for this one and I like the phone more than IPhone X and 11.I don‚Äôt like heavy and big size so it fits my need and performance is top notch."
Brilliant,"It‚Äôs everything i expected it to be. In a market where thick heavy and monster sized smartphones are ubiquitous, this is a life saver for people like me who just want a thin and light smartphone that‚Äôs also easy to hold with one hand without compromising on performance. I have a gripe with modern mid range phones that are packed with 4 cameras but still take awful photos. This phone takes good photos with the limited range of its single camera, and I much prefer this. As for the battery, it‚Äôs..."
Worth every penny,It's pretty good but battery decrease too fast nd a good product
Terrific,I purchased this iPhone for my dad because of his requirements of small sized phone with decent performance and capable camera. This is the ideal phone for these requirements. He is pretty satisfied with the phone. My only complaint is  5 W Charger. After all it's cost over 40k.
Excellent,First off all what a fantastic delivery  flipkart made. I ordered the phone on 9th July 5:20 PM. Received the the phone on 10th July 9 Am.Now coming to the phone. Its already been reviewed by many tech reviewer nothing more to say.Performance is great. Battery part is ok. As u have to compare the battery with iPhone 7 and 8. Not with XR or iPhone 11.One thing I did not like was there were no first charger only 5 volt charger is packed.Other then that it's a great purchase.If it's your fi...
Super!,"My first ever Apple product.It's small, snappy, has Touch Id (Apple pioneered in it).I am astonished as to how such a small phone can outstand every other phone.Reasons to buy:1. Camera (Don't get fooled coz of one lens)2. Performance (A13 bionic chip)3. Screen (Small and reachable by single hand)4. Power packed features (4K-60fps, water resistant, A13 chip, more secure touch ID, wireless charging, quick charging)5. PriceCons:1. Outdated look.2. Battery is very small although it la..."
Mind-blowing purchase,Fantastic product super fast speed no lags like android phones no advertisements fabulous response to touch good battery life there is this wrong saying that battery life is not good
Great product,"This is more of my legal first iPhone. Been using borrowed ones or sticking with android this whole time. Coming from the world of android, my first word to describe iOS is ‚Äúcool‚Äù. Bye bye heat issues from android phones. Believe me I tested this phone to enormous stress but still there‚Äôs no heat issues. My old Samsung note 8 didn‚Äôt boil that much but my one plus did. And bye bye blotwares. Regarding this phone, chick to carry. Enough screen space to read e-books, see movies.But adding m..."
Wonderful,I have using iPhone XR except of the screen size Every thing is great about this phone se 2020 Speak about battery it‚Äôs far better compare to iPhone 8 The new processor is helping a lot  and fast enough Small in size
Wonderful,"This is my first apple phone, previously I was using OnePlus 3T.Upgrading from android to IOS was a tough decision since I was getting the latest oneplus 8 in the same price range with offers.However I stuck with my decision of upgrading to IOS since I have found that IOS technology is better than android phones.Only CON with Apple is the battery. The battery runs out pretty fast. Well that is something I miss, nothing else.Great phone, slim and very fast. cheers!!"
Highly recommended,I would like to say only one thing iPhone rocks. The stereo sound quality is just at par with other phones in this range. Connect to your external HPs or soundbars and your are ready to rock and roll. Deep bass level are so clear u would fall in love with this. I really don‚Äôt mind bulky bezels because that is what makes this handy and your very own and personal phone. It‚Äôs a powerful beast in a small size. :)
Excellent,Tremendous purchase and awesome device . First of all it‚Äôs as per the latest lifestyle like 2 sim option and in a pocket size at such a great price. I am very happy and satisfied.
Excellent,"One of the best thing about this phone is its Apple A13 Bionic processor speed. You can buy a phone with 20000/- of another brand with high RAM capacity but no one focuses on processor benchmark number. Lightning speed in a small pack of phone is very satisfying and really good for working people who want to make a fast call, want to check WhatsApp quickly etc. The camera is also very good for the given specs and takes video with 4K resolution. I highly recommend this phone for people who a..."
Fair,"Ahhh where to start.!!, yes simple and daily usage mobile, one day battery life for normal usage. Great performance with A13 Bionic chip. Apple selling this mobile without technology, there is no great things to do, iPhone 8 with latest processor, if you can afford go for iPhone XR or iPhone 11, else go for one plus 8 series."
Perfect product!,"This is the best phone you can buy in this price. With this #banchinaproducts moment, this is the best option.I know this product is assembled in china but its a American product so I am satisfied. Its a breakthrough of great performance and minimalist design."
Just wow!,"I have been using the iPhone se 2020 for close to a week now and I am super happy with the experience. As you might have seen in multiple reviews of the device, the battery life is a setback. But the battery easily lasts for a day with a good amount of gaming and video streaming and that works for a user like me."
Great product,It‚Äôs a great IPhone. Those who are using 6 and 6s should definitely upgrade. But those who are using 7 and above should not as 7 is still a fast phone and it will get atleast one more year of update. Coming to iPhone se it‚Äôs a great phone. Camera is great. Features are great. Battery is issue. It won‚Äôt last you whole day if your a heavy user. Expect 5 hours of screen time of your heavy user. Otherwise overall good value for money.
Very Good,"se Apple is good phone , quick delivery, good camera, handy, easily useable but without gst reverse bill . ipurchased this phone for my company but flipkart not give me gst reverse bill"
Love it,"Excellent phone. For budget-minded users, this SE version is about half the price of the iPhone 11 and is easily comparable in its operations, even using the latest A13 processor which is new in the 11. All said this is a great phone, very well worth the money, and a great deal from Flipkart...Kudos!!!"
Super!,"The best phone after 5S. People who are into only basic features they must go for this phone. Value for money. Compact, handy and the best budget iPhone ever."
Worth the money,"I used windows phone, android phone (Lenovo and Moto) and now this. I am not impressed more than my previous phone Moto X4 to this. Be it charging, ease of using. I got used to Moto actions so much that I unintentionally do the same operation here and then realise that I am no longer using Moto.Since it is still a week when I started using iPhone would like to wait for a month to see to find the ease of use."
Very Good,"I eat Android every morning but shifted to iphone to experience the ios for the first time.About the phone build and finishing is just awesome. Red is beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è. Performance is killer, no lags at all. Every app works perfectly butter smooth. camera is very good and very natural kinda photography. Inorder to use an iphone it should be used with lot of conditions. Like keeping the battery always between 30 to 90 to keep up the battery health.Battery and Design are only drawbacks for this ..."
Brilliant,"I gifted it to my girlfriend she is very happy with it but it‚Äôs not for show off, people might make fun of you using this product, I‚Äôm thinking of buying 12 pro for her in sometime"
Awesome,"It is an awesome device, you get all the perfomance you need in this small form factor size. Display quality is good, camera is awesome (could have been better). The only disappointment is battery, you will get an average of 5 hours after full charge. If you are looking for a device with excellent perfomance in a small form factor and can compromise with the battery then this one is for you."
Brilliant,"My first iPhone!! Expected size a little bigger, but it's pretty amazing and handy. More preferrable to girls because of its handy size and battery status. Display, smoothness and many things are *100 times better than Android. Also got the instant discount of 3600. Thank you Flipkart for the amazing product and on time delivery. Nice experience!"
Does the job,"this phone is a camera beast,has a fastest processor A13 Bionic ,most colour accurate display, best haptics, beautiful & slim design its dammn great but only the con in this phone is the bettery life its not good believe me i have tested this phone with video, social media,and gaming but bettery life is the only this that takes this phone back.so if bettery life is your priority don't go for this. rest all good."
Fair,"GIVING THIS REVIEW AFTER 15/16 daysBATTERY‚ÄîWorst ,trust me if you‚Äôr a student and giving your classes online then kindly don‚Äôt buy,because it‚Äôs battery literally is the worst part of this phone....It‚Äôs been almost 15 days since I am using this phone and it‚Äôs battery Heath has decreased up to 3% and that to just within 15 days and trust me I did each and everything to make sure that it‚Äôs battery Heath don‚Äôt decrease so fast ,like I saw as well as read each and every article about how to keep ..."
Good choice,"So basically I shifted from android to IOS , this was the cheapest iPhone and this phone is not for those who play long gaming hour , although this phone can handle any game , battery backup is decent not great but not terrible either ,it last for almost whole day for me , I just use phone for Mail,Call‚Äôs,WhatsApp and some YouTube . Camera is good and the feel premium and is very light and using IOS for first time was not easy , almost took 2 day to understand this phone completely, now every..."
Mind-blowing purchase,"I am happy to share here the experience I acquired on Flipkart.  Apple and a great creation.  Awesome in terms of performance, not like the company said in terms of battery.  It takes a maximum of two and a half hours to fully charge.  As far as the camera is concerned we can only take the best portrait we know of its function after use, overall awesome.  The best phone for this price ..."
Simply awesome,"Just wow. This phone‚Äôs a breeze. The apple ecosystem is obviously extraordinary and with the phone‚Äôs chip and ram management one wouldn‚Äôt have no lag whatsoever. The camera is excellent and for my usage the battery is sufficient. Better carry a powerbank if you‚Äôre a heavy user. If you want a small form factor device and doesn‚Äôt want to lavishly splash money, then just go for this."
Super!,"Its my first iphone. Always wanted to own an iphone and boy its such a great first one. Its really refreshing to use a small screen after such a longe time and it'll surely take some time to get used to it (again). I seriously don't like to use  my old oneplus 6 now but ios has some limitations or rather it would take time to get used to it. Thanks flipkart for delivering it the next day, something that i didn't expect from flipkart."
Super!,Stands to its reputation ‚Ä¶. Apple as always ‚Ä¶ - smooth af- secure af - sturdy af- stunning afApple af ;)

Perfect product!,It's a good buy. If you want to experience the apple brand. I would suggest you to buy the product. Apple phones are actually good for around 3-4 years post that because of software updates they become quite slow. So a good phone if you usually change your phone post 3 years of usage.
Must buy!,"Keep it simple.To be used as a phone only : Social media apps, video calling , navigation., Quick HD photography , all your day to day utility apps etc...Special call out on the camera which is brilliant and allows you to take amazing pictures and editing features.Not suitable for using it as a gaming , movie watching , high screen time consumption activity device - the screen and battery are just not made for it."
Best in the market!,An iPhone with duel sim capability and a decent battery life. What else do I want?? Extremely handy. Switched from android and loving the decision. a phone that‚Äôs better than one plus in all aspects (including price as well). A beautiful piece of equipment.
Awesome,Compact yet powerful. It‚Äôs small size is what made me buy it. Small phones with decent performance and good build quality are a rare sight these days. Go for it if you don‚Äôt like to carry phones as big as chopping boards in your pockets.
Worth every penny,"1. Camera is too good.2. Performance it's also good just like a beast in a small pack.3. I don't know why people said about its battery is not good, I think it's good for this phone size ,screen that's why it's a beast in a speed test."
Good quality product,"This is a great phone with old school features as required by me. Been using for a week n performance great, no lag n only small screen as compared to samsung s10. but that what i wanted a small phone. 1 very important thing battery is very good pls dont  read too much as a normal user doing office mails n taking calls battery lasts for 10 hours. for gaming n watching movies perspective its not a great phone but dats not what i wanted so fits d bill for me. guys planing to buy this - its a..."
Decent product,Cons: 1. Finger print response time is very slow compared with older version iPhones.. 2. Apps are hanging and restarting ..  3. left side loud speaker is very low compared to right side speaker.4. Reachable facility is not working properly as home button response is very bad  I never felt this kind of issues in older iPhones .. Pros:   1. Good display 2. Good camera 3. Good network coverage
Pretty good,"Great phone. Tough to find such compact phones in the android world. If only Apple had given a charger and earphones, it'd have been awesome. Battery life is fine but not that great. Rest everything is 10 on 10"
Just wow!,"The best cell phone for those who likes smaller screen size and same performance like XR. Camera clarity is awesome. I am a fan of iPhone, used 4S, 6 and 6S. SE looks like 6/6S but performance is far better."
Terrific,"This phone is all that you want it for. All the high end phones from other brands may give you good experience but so does iPhone SE and some more. It is splendid in rendering anything you want it to do. Whether playing games, taking photographs, enjoy watching videos online or in an app, everything is smooth and a pleasure to do. The haptic engine enhances any game you play (as it‚Äôs described in other brand phones description and reviews). No complaints, except that the battery is just decen..."
Brilliant,I am writing this review after 9 days of use. I didn't play games but my son install pubg mobile and it works fine. I use it for various bank transactions and official use only for the reason for security purposes. And the battery works upto 36 hrs. I am happy to have a nice mobile like this though it is little bit pricey.
Simply awesome,"One of best phone, I upgrade from Iphone 7.. as said battery mAh is 1821 only but it is far better than 3000 mAh of other android phone.. and so fast, I love it.."
Terrific,"Like many others this was my first iPhone. Being an android user I was very apprehensive at first but decided to give it a shot. At first the only thing that looked out of league was the screen size, but trust me once you get used to it this won‚Äôt even matter. As for the performance it has everything for your day to day need. A stunning camera, premium glass back look and smooth performance will be more than enough for you to win over. Read a lot of negative reviews about battery but if you..."
Simply awesome,Fabulous performance with improved battery than previous model which i bought in 2017.....worth buying ....single camera is enough with improved quality ....and better than its rival one plus .......if you want a smaller size phone with great performance than go for it
Fabulous! Excellent yet Powerful !!,"Have been using iPhone right from years now , upgraded this iPhone Se from iPhone 6s plus , It is simply amazing how it feels and is a very smooth and small phone which i loved .It has small design which makes it very easy to use and it simply doesn't feel big , people who don't like big phones can simply go with it ."
Super!,Happy to using iPhone. It‚Äôs easy to handle with one hand and can keep it any packet easily. I liked it because of small size. Only defeat with this mobile battery backup it will dry quickly. But it can charge fast can be manageable for it employee because we can‚Äôt go anywhere longtime.
Classy product,"Great phone.. I always wanted a phone that can fit my pocket (in terms of size) and this slim, smart and handy phone is best from apple at reasonable price Good product"
Fabulous!,"Amazing masterpiece this. Didn‚Äôt want to buy either of the bigger iPhones 11,12,13(out of the question) did some research and then got this.. and I‚Äôm loving it so far Classy Red colour and feels amazing to use it"
Highly recommended,Everything is fantastic abt this phone except battery backup.. it hardly stays for half a day if u keep using it frequently‚Ä¶ and fast charging is not so effective as some other models
Great product,Good design feels good in hand performance is great only battery is small but it managing well somehow I need to charge it in the end of the day according to my usage. And hope Apple would upgrade night mode camera in this device in upcoming update. I Don't have any issue with screen size although it depends on the personal preferences. I prefer compact phones
Good quality product,"This phone is good but not as good as iPhone 5s when we compare with that phone of its time, yet this is much upgraded with that now as up now but 5s is master piece"
Brilliant,The best phone ever.. I like small size mobiles & this satisfied me Best Phone 5*****Charging also full day with normal usage I don‚Äôt play games I use wallets & calls mostlyIt was the best iPhone 128gb ..
Worth every penny,Camera quality is better and have 4k recording feature. performance is faster . Better battery life in normal usage . Unable to add photos beacause im using it right now
Excellent,"Awesome product from apple at a great price. Superb performance and way better than any phone in this price range. Do buy it in discounts, Kudos to Flipkart for amazing discount and early delivery"
Fabulous!,"Very Good product I love my iPhone, it is very good I good deal and exchange my old phone."
Must buy!,"In today's bigger screen and higher refresh rate age of Android phones, it is going to be treated as small screen, lower battery etc. But as a new entrant in apple eco system, it seems to be a good buy. Bit tough to use after 8 years of feature phone use and another 8 years of Android use. But love this challange. ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èüíñüëå"
Classy product,This phone is real value for money and I just got it for 29990If you give your old phone you can get it at much lesser price Just ensure you put a tough screen guard for top and a tough mobile cover which is slightly raised from the sides
Simply awesome,Everything is awesome in terms of the product and delivery time . The product was delivered within less then 24 hrs .the iPhone SE 2020 which I ordered came as per the expected delivery date and time . Now regarding the product its completely brand new with proper original packing and the feel of the mobile is awesome . If I talk about the performance overll its too good in other words fantastic .A very happy customer I am . Thank you Flipkart for this amazing product . Just wow .

Best in the market!,"In your hand you can feel the build quality, it is small but powerful camera is so damn good only drawback is like other iPhones we are not getting night mode . In my point of view iphone is always iphone they wont compromise the product quality  for the cost cutting . Within the price range you cant find any android phone which is having these much features. Im an android user for past 9 yrs initially  faced some issue but going on i used to it . If you dont have enough money to get larger i..."
Best in the market!,"I got 64 GB, product red.. it is very handy and ios 15 is stunning . considering battery if you are a heavy user this phone is not for you,   But for my usage its good..Camera is good, but it will detect only face in portrait not objects, obviously due to Apple‚Äôs new environmental policy they will not include charger in box. Its compact at the same time its slippery too. A13 bionic can handle games seamlessly but battery will drain fast. There is no heating issues so far. I installed all the..."
Just wow!,"Firstly great thanks to flipkart for the offer price and also for the quick delivery and genuine productI have been an iphone user since almost 8 yrs now and wanted a secondary phone and I bought this, absolutely handy device and awesome in every way, battery life is also really great, no complaints üòä"
Worth the money,"Received my device in 48 hours, that too at a remote place. This is my 3rd iPhone ( After iPhone 4S & iPhone 6). Well‚Ä¶. The device is slim & display is top notch. Interface is super quick. Camera is Ok. But I ain‚Äôt disappointed since, I use iPhone for official purposes. For photography my Samsung A50 is doing a terrific job. Battery life, I feel, is better than previous iPhone 6. What really disappointed me is 1) No charger came with the box. Luckily I had my previous charger 2) No earphon..."
Simply awesome,"This is a very special device with much comfortable in hand. Cameras are very good compared to previous gen iPhones, just a major drawback is the battery. Usually it gives 4 hours of SOT which is satisfactory. Those who are planning to buy an iPhone which has good in hand feeling and nice cameras with super performance, then go for it"
Classy product,"This is what love looks like...Up to the mark, with performance and battery, and exceeds expectations with camera quality. Superbly built, and given the fact I got this for 21k is surreal...."
Worth every penny,"Absolute compact phone.those who need one handy phone,pls go for itPerformance at the best level Camera also good ,except night photographsVideo quality at the super level Battery up to mark as its 1821 mAh(screen on time:5 hours if not play BGMI or COD) Screen LCD panel still bright and colour Sound quality also the best Networks good(as i use airtel ,no issue at all)100% recommended"
Awesome,"I‚Äôm a iphone xs user so, this is my secondary phone so I expected a good battery life since my xs has 88% battery life left but the thing is the battery is draining way to fast so I guess it didn‚Äôt solve my problem and the performance is excellent and the camera is not as good as xs but in this price range you get what you pay for and yaa i think it‚Äôs a great phone if you don‚Äôt use your phone as much as a gamer do... I would suggest you to go for the iphone 12 mini as it not much of a price ..."
Perfect product!,It is a good phone at this price range and In my point of view as a apple lover if you have less budget you can purchase it i really loved it üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Worth upgrading from iPhone 7 to iPhone SE 2020 ,"Just upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone SE 2020, Great features great camera great performance"
Classy product,I needed a phone which would perform 1 like a beast when I use it 2 had a good camera which would last and 3 fits in one hand  but I ‚Äòm a very limited user so this phone is perfect for me I use my iPad and for content consumption and work so choose according to your needs
Excellent,Clicks photographs like an entry level dslr. Best for daily usage if you are not a heavy gamer. Best in segment and class
Good choice,"Compact, powerful and elegant. Decent camera and display for this price range with A13 chip.Battery life is also okay for an average user. A satisfied purchase from Flipkart."
Worth every penny,"Great value for money phone. Coming from the big phones this was sleek, smooth elegant great comfortable to hold. This is not for the heavy usage people because of the small form battery. But a very decent battery for normal use like calls and whatsapp. White color looks more premium and no ear piece and phone heating issue on long calls. Nice phone and Flipkart service is also goods."
Decent Product,"I'm writing this review after the usage of 6 months. Its a classic product. Performance is above our expectations and camera quality is awesome. The most impressive feature about apple products is its stabiliy for longer periods. Even after receiving numerous updates for the last few months, its stability ha not gone down unlike android phones. The only disappointed fact with regard to SE2 is battery. Really disappointing. Else its a great phone with powerful chipset. I recommend this phone..."
Value-for-money,"Its a great phone in value for money. Works fine with A13 chip..  all good.got it from 33k .Point to be considered. It dont have face recognition , finger print works fine .Also with no headset no or usb charging cable coming. One lighting cable and the phone will deliver only. You have to change this from laptop or buy usb type charger cable and adapter later"
Brilliant,"This is my first iphone and its great !!! This phone is fast and smooth, Camera is par with iphone 11 except the wideangle ofc. I am writing this review after 4 months and till now no major problem or anything just a con is the battery. If you a couch potato and wants a phone for netflix and video streaming then this wont be the perfect choice for you. The battery life is pretty good is your usage is less. Pubg and other games run like butter no lags no shutters just you wont be able to play ..."
Delightful,"Amazing phone with very good performance. Currently the best compact phone available in the market. Worst part about the phone is its battery. No matter if you are a heavy user or no, this phone needs to be charged atleast twice in a day. Even if you dont use the phone for a full day it needs to be charged twice. The 5W charger that they provide in the box is slower than a turtle. It takes flat 2 hrs to fully charge."
Terrific,1. Camera is good in good light condition in indoor camera is decent 2. Performence is superb 3 . Look premium
Perfect product!,"While we go deep in review we need to understand a fact that this phone is not for heavy users and for photo enthusiasts.night pictures are not up to mark, but that even apple isn‚Äôt claiming for this particular phone.This phone is very light in weight and delivers very well for what it meant to be.Things which I like about this phone:1. Light in weight2. Having A13 chip set, which delivers all task smoothly 3. Cost effective phone to enter in apple eco systemIn the end while purcha..."
Best in the market!,"Great performance,great camera and fabulous product at reasonable price. Thanks apple and Flipkart for fast and secure delivery"
Really Nice,"If someone ask me for to make choices between iPhone and android phones I always choose iPhone onlyAbout IPHONE SE superb and fantastic who are looking for handy phone with 4.7 inch screen, with all the latest features and choices."
Must buy!,Light in hand it‚Äôs an Apple product which easily outperforms any and all of its contenders. Packed with all the features it introduces the concept of esim in dual sim with one physical and other esim activated through network provider. It takes just 2 hrs for activation and SMS after 24 hrs. Bandwidth performs slightly better compared to physical one. Image quality is always best and gaming rendering is perfect without lag. Storage and app availability is also good. Not to mention the Audio q...
Perfect product!,One of the best mobile with fantastic camera really loved it but coming to display size and battery backup just little bit disappointed rather then this iPhone se simply good üòç
Terrific,Best iPhone at this price range. If u want handy iphone with best processor. Then it will suits for u.
Simply awesome,Wow worth for money for this price I still use this last 4 months superb performance Great quality I dropped many time no damage in body and display thank u iphone and Flipkart
Highly recommended,"If you are not into playing games on mobile, then this is the best phone. Quality is amazing. Each and every component is premium whether we talk about camera or even microphone. Most people don‚Äôt realise the amount of tiny compromises made by Android phones to reduce cost. iPhone is expensive because it doesn‚Äôt compromise on quality even for things that people barely notice. And the best part is that you will continue to receive free OS updates for at least 5 years."
Awesome,"A powerful beast . iOS is smooth as always. Camera is wow , you can use this as portable camera for your road trips , size is just perfect . Everything is fine from my side , I will update regarding the battery backup after using few months ."
Perfect product!,"Absolutely fantastic product for the price. It's handy, good for people who prefer small phones. I love the performance."
Simply awesome,"I'm no one to review this product, since as everyone knows it's APPLE and they maintain the quality as usual. The feedback I can give on this is regarding Flipkart, the package was good, delivery was fast & safely handed over the product.Adding some personal feel-good points;-1. Pure piece of tech art2. Red color is something really needs to look, touch n feel3. freaking handy [better to use a case to maintain that look for long]4. Not recommended for hardcore phone addicts when consid..."
Delightful,"Don't wait too much to think , just go for it if you have this in mind. Yes it's a compact device and if you have been using phones with big display then it may feel tiny at first but you would get used to it. A13 bionic is a charm and this brings out camera performance out if the older hardware that this phone has. It's a hybrid beast of a device and can suffice any day to day task. Yes if your intention is heavy gaming then the battery won't last long as it's tiny body holds a small capaci..."
Delightful,"Display, Performance, Handling is awesome.Onle two issues you have to mahe with:-Continuous use of phone will drain out battery very fast.Camera performance in good light condition is awesome, it's unbeatable. But in low light you will not get such performance. Otherwise it's an awesome product.Battery standby performance is awesome. As I go to office, after charging it 100% at 08:30 am, battery after 12 hours stays at around 50% in normal usage. However coming back home and then using fo..."
Fabulous!,All are well Good and much better than 11 .but battery backup is too bad. I give this rating after 3 months..
Pretty good,"Its small,sleek and handy. Powered by A13 bionic. So this one is a performance beast in a small body. When it comes to design,its same as iphone 8 but the internals are quite different. It has only one wide angle camera but that one is great. The display is an ips retina display which is not bad. The main drawback is the battery. This phone has 1821mah battery which is too small. If you are a hardcore user then it wont last for a day. And this phone is Ip67 rated and supports wireless and fas..."
Brilliant,"Upgraded from 5s, feeling great while using it the touch is smooth and iOS blends perfectly with the hardware"
Wonderful,Great Product In terms of Camera and Processing the image The A13 Bionic chip does its job Great The battery could be better. Overall great product
Just wow!,nice product...just be cautious to use the phone judiciously ....in general with light gaming i am getting around a full day with 30% battery left...mostly use it as my primary non-gaming  purpose. love the size..fits well unlike a 6 inch phone
Just wow!,I prefer small phones so this was the perfect choice and the rate at which it was available made it possible for me to buy my first iPhone. Thanks to Flipkart for providing such amazing offer.
Just wow!,The phone is very fast and smooth never gave me any issue the battery is on low side but camera to gaming all are on top of the line for casual people you don't need a dslr this phone can take some great photos and videos
Must buy!,i love it just amazing in every field. those who love small and powerful phone they can go for it. superb performance
Wonderful,"its really good especially the red colour. among 2 variants of 64 gb and 128gb , i will recommend for 128 gb unless it is not for elderly people. It is much cheaper as compared to IPhone 11 and 12 though u get almost everything ."
"Mind-blowing purchase, Go for it!","I loved it... This phone gives a sense of luxury, security, and good worth of money. Highly recommend this one. Surprisingly the size of it is perfect, never thought it but it is just perfect. Only one con i.e battery performance is just average will give you 4-5 hrs of SOT but it has a great stand-by time. Go for it!"
Fabulous!,Phone reached me safely. Packaging was nice. Happy with the seller‚Äôs integrity. A Mighty handy phone for everyday use. Battery is on the lower side and hardly needs a charge every evening depending on the usage. Otherwise A class.
Wonderful,"Most affordable classy phone in the market , I bought this product red for my mother and this color enhanced the glamour of the person holding it."
Great product,I am writing this review after few days of use so it is just awesome. Camera quality is not satisfactory as the video made by this phone are yellowish in colour as compared to other phone videos.Speed is just awesome as A13 Bionic chip is there.     Battery is 1800 mAh so it doesn‚Äôt last long as iPhones are not made for long lasting batteries but they are light in weight and high performance with no problem of hang.I used my Iphone 6s for 4 years 8 months so I expect this one to last ling ...
Fabulous!,"Excellent investment if you want to experience ios at such a low price with flagship features. If you love classic phones, it is just made for you. You can do everything in this phone. Battery is not so good, but if you are not a heavy user, it will work for you. Camera is excellent as compared to other android phones but not as good as other iphones. It will feel glossy in your hands. And rest all the features are just brilliant."
Super!,"I‚Äôve been using this iPhone since last 6 months previous to this I was using iPhone 7. It is the awesome phone without a doubt. But if you want a bigger screen you‚Äôre not going to enjoy this, if you want a compact and comfortable screen this is the phone to purchase."
Good choice,"Overall it‚Äôs a good mobile for daily usage, those who like compact phone and don‚Äôt not play much games and don‚Äôt watch much movies can buy this phone as battery and small screen are concern."
Awesome,"If you like to use a premium phone, solid buildup design and processor then don‚Äôt give it a second thought. It‚Äôs so gooood I love it!!! There is no comparison between android and apple"
Brilliant,This is my first iPhone and I start this journey with best technology A13 bionic chip with a economical budget it's fantastic and I always keen to use Apple technology in future. Worthy
Highly recommended,It‚Äôs a very fast usable with one hand it‚Äôs camera is also very nice it can shoot videos up 4K 60 FPS if it‚Äôs battery would be bigger it would be an ideal phone
Perfect product!,such a really nice phone but is this only undar 30k best its value is only 30k is ok more than not good
Awesome,"Writing the review after 6 months usage--no lags, battery is good for one day usage.-not for gaming-u get good  üì∑ Next powerful after 7, 8 with latest processor.It‚Äôs just better if u want to upgrade from 6s or later, like I did."
Super! and Value for money product from Apple,Amazing product from apple and got at a special price during the Republic day sale on Flipkart Pros:Fast processorSuperb CameraPremium fit and FinishHassle free interfaceBloatware free (its IOS)Cons:None except for short battery life but still people will like it and better than any other phones in this price range
Decent product,"There you have a youngest phone of the apple family in term of price ,but this little champ is very weak in term of battery life otherwise SE is good to go for any fight because it got the right genes As an secondary phone this will work best otherwise carry an powerbank with you"
Worth the money,"Iphone doesn't need any major review as it's already a pioneer in its own field. However qeith Iphone SE, this works well for those who have tight budget and can't afford high end iphones. Works well for single hand usage, quite good screen to body ratio and latest processor (iphone 11). Will not disappoint anyone who would like to go for iphone."
Value-for-money,A good phone I say but not the best As battery life is not at all to the apple standard. Otherwise value for money if available during offer period.
Highly recommended,"Awesome phone, small and handy, I got it for just 21,500 with exchange ....so it was a great deal.....performance is top notch ,display is at its best, ,sound quality is good,camera is at its best with great video recording at 4k 60 fps and portrait mode is also goodOnly problem that I found was that iPhone starts vibrating when speakers are in use .Overall its good ..go for it guys"
Classy product,"It‚Äôs been almost a week since I‚Äôve started using the phone and it‚Äôs pretty impressive for the specs it gets. I upgraded from the 6 which happens to have the same battery as this one but the phone has been lasting a complete day easily and definitely way more than my 6 did when I bought it. Coming to the highly complained 1821 mAh battery, I charge it in the morning around 9 and it has 20% left before I go to bed. Then again, it‚Äôll vary from user to user.The iOS experience along with the A13..."
Decent product,"I bought it for 26k during sale, so it was a good deal. These are the pros and cons which I listed after using it for 2 months.Pros1. Good Camera.2. Incredible performance. 3. Water and dust resistant.4. Tells your usage time.5. Handy to use.Cons1. Pathetic battery(android phones with price < 6k have outstanding battery)2. Takes too long for charging(1.5 hr from 0 to 100)3. No physical slot for second sim card, it has esim feature. (Not all service providers give this facility)4. ..."
Good,"I always wanted to buy an iPhone, to myself experience the Hype surrounding it. Finally, I bought it during the Big Billion Days Sale on Flipkart & below are my observations after using it for almost 3 months.1) Sound: If you not using any earphones, headphones or any other Bluetooth Devices for getting Sound output, then Sound output of the Mobile in use plays a very important part. While on a call in a noisy Environment & having patchy Network, it becomes very difficult to have a proper c..."
Classy product,My dream phone. When I was in college in year 2015 most of my friends who had ‚Äúrich parents‚Äù had iphones and I always dreamed of owning one. In fact that time I just had the nokia push button old phone which wasn‚Äôt even a smart phone.With the blessing of my mother and the support of my brother I was able to fulfill this dream of owning an iPhone.I am not an expert of mobile but I am grateful to flipkart and its seller for providing great discount so that it became affordable for common peo...
Awesome,Apple is Apple.... One can not compare its performance and class with any android phone. Apple phone is only comparable to another apple phone only. Loved this phone. Superb finish of the Product Red. Feels very premium in the hand and its performance is awesome though one can not compare to iPhone‚Äôs latest models. This is the perfect phone for small to medium sized screen lovers. And hats off to Flipkart for such deals.
Awesome,If you want a compact and handy phone ..just go for it. I boight it for its size. Battery backup is decent considering the size and performance. Value for money.
Highly recommended,Best budget phone for proffessional user.It is best suitable phone for isers who don‚Äôt use phone for gaming.It gives me a full day battery life with continuous 4g On
Classy product,"Pros:1. Top notch performance2. Very good display3. Pretty handy in size4. Beautiful design5. Battery is far better than 1st Generation SE. Just do the following when you get the device, Enable power save mode, disable background refresh. You can happily use the back up more than a day. 6. You can charge the device 60-70% in an hour with 5W charger. Pretty decent.7. When you get the device first thing to do is update the IOS from 13.6v to 14.0v. You will definitely feel the difference ..."
Highly recommended,"This is my first iPhone, switched over from android and I am using this phone for a month now.So here are some things I found, as an overall product is it very good, if you like small phones like me.Now talking about Pros:1.

Just wow!,I am hard-core android user recently i used redmi note 5pro and it has 4000mah battery and its battery life is goodAnd after using iphone se i am shocked its battery is good and performance is best in class and i used OnePlus also believe me OnePlus and any android never replace a iphone iPhone is iphone in all point Camera is bestPerformance is best in classDisplay is small but its okayBattery is also good
Wonderful,"The phone is brilliant however the battery performance is not great Max 1 day battery life for a normal usage Highly not recommended for gaming Camera is good The interface reminds of old iPhones Value for money Ppl looking for small compact phone, this the best phone however need to compromise with the battery."
Good quality product,"This is my 2nd iPhone after 6years came back with excitement & here it is SE it‚Äôs simply clever, for excitement this right treat for me.My 1st IPhone 5s gifted from my sweet heart for cross 1st year after my lover came wife she gifted for my 1st anniversary.I love small screen phone 5s, 5se, 6, now 2020 SE comes with everything into in small phone except battery üòî Apple can put better battery capacity for SE but ok it‚Äôs shoots for everyone except for gamers. It‚Äôs fits into your budget & p..."
Delightful,"Flipkart took 2 weeks to deliver the product. Never mind, the phone is really good,compact. The charge drops a bit fast ,for heavy users it should last for a max of 6-7 hours. Rest everything is just top notch. Best budget buy"
Worth every penny,Super
Mind-blowing purchase,Awsm phone

Highly recommended,Awesome
Classy product,Good phone
Mind-blowing purchase,Iphone se is amezing
Brilliant,Everything is good but sometimes phone heats up fast
Terrific,Android to iOS.love itPerformance loaded phone
Fair,Except the battery life phone is pretty good for the price tag
Delightful,Battery is not long lasting and the phone gets heatup during charging..
Must buy!,Very good
Good quality product,All is good except the battery
Super!,Nice  product in low buget from Apple Store
Worth every penny,I used iPhone X and 11 bt I can‚Äôt get Comfort while useing bt se 2020 is most Comfortable and beautiful phone I like it  phone should be like se
Pretty good,The phone could be the best in segment if equipped with a turbo or wireless charger and Bluetooth EarPods. It gives a premium feel with a compact 4.7‚Äù design and Super fast processor.
Worth every penny,Great product as usual. Good for a days use. Need a fast charger with it to get the best performance in short time. There‚Äôs nothing to complain except battery performance.
Very Good,Everything is fine except battery. I‚Äôm not an pubg player so I can‚Äôt Specify the performance on basis of pubg. But I didn‚Äôt find any lag or slowness in this phone. Main point of this phone is.- very thin and slimYou will love it when you will start using it.I think only drawback is it‚Äôs battery. If the battery was good. It  was best. But anyway we can not expect that much battery backup from apple.I think apple should do more work on battery at least make it on the mark.I bought it aft...
Delightful,"It‚Äôs a good product overall... slightly overpriced.. battery is really bad...doesn‚Äôt last long...Performance wise good, fast . Superb camera pixel quality very good even with zoomed photos.."
Great product,Good specs at best price I‚Äôve Recently upgraded from iPhone 8 to iPhone se and I would say this is a great upgrade and worth. This new SE phone great at performance and quality
Must buy!,Nice I phone  small compact and light weight... processor is too good and as usual headphone quality awesome Nice packing .. thanx Flipkart for great service
Awesome,pretty awesome phone .. loved its compact style and performance .
Perfect product!,Mobile is working awesome fast and smooth. Camera is very awesome but problem is only size of mobile displayBut over all I‚Äôm very happy with phone
Great product,I have been using iPhone earlier as well. This one is more brilliant phone with high performance speed and i love the perfect size of the phone
Fabulous!,The rumors about this phone of its low battery backup are fake. It provides the best battery backup and lasts a full day with light use like Instagram and WhatsApp. The performance of this phone is the best compared to android phones at this price range. And with the iOS 14 update the iPhone SE is the star of the show . And there are no such noticable differences between the SE and the 12
Just wow!,"Switched from iPhone 6 to iPhone SE 2020.Never wanted the big sizes, this is the best option as a beast in a small shell.Battery backup is fine which is around 6 hours in a single charge with dual sim.Other all functionalities are excellent as expected.In a short note, giving 9 on 10 for this product."
Really Nice,Exilent phoneüòÄüòÄ
Moderate,Only good thing about this phone is its processor.What is the use of good processor if you ve average camera below average screen size. I ve not udapted to new software but the UI is not that friendly with the present software version. You ll get very good Android phone for the same price. Or if you can shell out extra bucks then go for higher version of iPhone. This is not worth it.
Mind-blowing purchase,"From a first time iOS user I am using Pixel 4a and I got this phone for my wife. Very smooth experience, quite different then regular android and marginally better then Pixel's.Camera quality is quite good, even in comparison to Pixel, but I believe it's mostly because of its punchy colours.Layout/Usability/UI is quite different and it's taking some time to get used to it.Hardware is very premium, better then my existing pixel 4a.Functionality and Customization wise I find it lackin..."
Mind-blowing purchase,Iphone SE 2020 is the best iphone. I had iphone6 so i am used to this size and this screen size is perfectly fine and handy as well and light weight. Very happy with this buy. Bought a red one and its amazing red.
Great phone but disappointed with no accessories,Good phone but disappointed with no earpods and power adapter. Left a bittersweet taste.Battery backup is good enough for only decent usage. Not meant for gaming. Only for those who want entry into the Apple ecosystem at low cost
Just okay,"Ossam phone,my first I phone so very much excited to use this.everything is great except battery but u may optimise battery usage by making suitable settings and after that all great.  Finally want too say only one thing No I phone user will never use any other brand  phone."
Perfect product!,"Ordered iphone SE 2020 from Flipkart and no regrets till now.This is my second iPhone purchase from Flipkart and they delivered it well within time.Phone is genuine, nicely packed (hats off to Apple Packaging Team too)Very nice upgrade from IPhone 6 - 16 GB.Used it for more than a week now; seems flawless.The Red Product is a special one to own as Apple donates from the sales of Red Products.The glass back looks very nice, however needs lot of care to prevent scratches.Cons: Battery l..."
1 week user,"The product is great in itself, other than the battery. I have a 2016 iPhone 6 and the battery life if pretty similar to that. Really hoping that Apple does something about the battery life in coming update. Other than that everything is great and it delivers what you're promised. A-13 bionic chip will amaze you with the speed and camera is great, specially for the price. Great phone, just be aware that you'll have to charge it multiple times a day, so don't forget to carry a power bank!"
Great product,Best in the market Seriously no android phone can compete with this 4.7 inch beast performing device. A13 Bionic is far more superior than Snapdragon 865. I am an hardcore android guy & I am giving my genuine review after 4 days of extensive IOS usage
Really Nice,The iPhone SE 2020 is a real value for money mobile device. It has got the latest processor (A13 Bionic Chip) which is said to be the fastest processor that is present in the current market. The camera is a real catch having support for high definition video and photos that can be shot in portrait mode which adds a certain depth to the photos. The 4.7 inch screen is a real compact and comfy size for those who do not prefer large phone sizes. The battery life is great as well. All in all the i...
Pretty good,üò≠camera is not up to the mark specially in low light. Battery performance pathetic. If you use it day long then always keep power bank. Power adopter to be purchased separately that costs 2000/ othewise can not charge.ü§©Look wise excellent. Sound quality outstanding . Fast processor feels you satistified..
Fabulous!,Best camera quality a. A good option to buy at a reasonable price too. Would totally recommend buying this mobile
Excellent,Best phone at this range battery backup is also good display is awesome it is best phone for gaming and all other use Ram management is too good. This is best phone it is value for money.Just go for it
Very Good,"If you are looking for a handy phone with best display and camera, go for it. Battery backup isnt that great, would know if you had been an iphone user before, but overall its so worth it !"
Worth the money,Apple always best if you know how to jailbreak. Much faster processor battery too good and dual sim management better than non iOS device.
Super!,It's lighting fast and picture quality is marvelous. Excellent battery except that if you are more on online streaming and gaming then you need to carry a 20k mah power bank. Shipment was delivered before the mentioned date and packaging was firm and sturdy when received. Overall I rate 5/5. End of the day an iPhone is an iPhone. Thanks flipkart for the best online offer.
Fabulous!,Best phone at this price...camera is also great with right lighting... Very easy to use in one hand. Very light in weight but still gives a good feeling in hands.....battery backup is also not that bad as everybody says...the A13 chip uses the power very smartly.overall a good quality product at reasonable price.
"Excellent, worth buying.","I am writing this review after more than a months usage, so here are my observations and findings.1. Excellent OS, super fast A13 chip no lag at all. Nice animations, highly customization now with ios 14.1 update. It will amaze you.2. Superb display especially when you zoom a picture it retains its pixels, awesome.3. Amazing 4K video at 60 FPS, absolutely amazing clarity.4. Very good speakers.5. Very light weight infact you wont feel its in your pocket.6. Camera is great with good clar..."
Did not meet expectations,Users shifted from android to iphone may feel not worthy. In this price range we will get better phone in android   But Only satisfactory thing is the Brand and durabilityPerformance is goodSome automation functions are goodCamera AvgFast charging is plus from 20 to 70 % it took 30 to 40 min but to get 100% it took another 2 hoursI liked the size of the mobile so i choose thisThe below review is after 5 months of useMobile look was quality is good but it is too sensitive it got stopped...
Good choice,they took a lifetime to deliver but the phone is a masterpiece.
Mind-blowing purchase,Display and performance are very good. Handy to use and comfortable to keep in our pockets. Battery is the only drawback I face with this mobile. Apple could have been increased its capacity to little more to bare with latest generation.
Best in the market!,Super
Really Nice,powerful processor excellent camera But battery  backup  average
Pretty good,"I was using iPhone 6s earlier. So for me this phone is not an upgrade as such because the features are almost the same in both phones. Only in iPhone SE there is dual sim and front camera is of 7MP. Still I‚Äôm loving this phone. It has got a decent battery life (as compared to iPhone 6S) and the look and feel of this phone, especially in red colour is awesome. The camera and phone performance obviously are good as with all iPhones. For first time iPhone users, this should be the best phone to ..."
Just wow!,Pros :Excellent performanceZero lags Good software supportExcellent cameraBetter / stable apps compared to androidCons :Mediocre battery lifeNote: display is good enough for a 4.7'' phone. No pixelationIt can run all the demanding games and can take really good pics .  The only thing you need to understand is that for a heavy user the battery will last from 10 am - 4 pm
Super!,"Apple products are the best designed and architected devices with leading industry standards.this one is best for casual use. one of the fastest devices in this price range.Overpriced as per tech experts.The battery is best in ios devices. The camera is average but you can click stunning pics in Daylight. You can Opt for these Devices if your use is decent.If you love Android Os and Chinese phones such as Redmi, one plus then don't buy this one. Sometimes it is difficult to adjust indu..."
Mind-blowing purchase,"Pretty good device for the offer price, not that great battery life, everything else is top notch."
Could be way better,It is fully hawa Naz phone . Back bottom on top so it is not comfort to easy back chapare to other phone.Charger need to be commonized Battery need to be increase
Good,"I had no other option so opted for this as I have been using iPhone for the past 12 yrs now. People who love to be on most of the time(gaming n browsing), this piece is not good for you as battery still sucks. Music lovers you can have a superb feel on speaker as apple has got it better than previous ones."
Awesome,Apple is very nice but battery life not bad and Flipkart  very wonderful support and delivery nice payment very fast thank you so much Flipkart very useful every time good keep going my support anytime thank you sir
Wonderful,"Everything is excellent about this phone. Compact size, nice bright display, superb performance. Except for the battery. It hardly covers entire day. But over the time battery performance improved a little as it understands the usage."
Good small handset,"This is perfect phone for the people who like small mobiles. Camera and Sound Quality is good. Battery could be better. No dedicated headphone jack like old SE , Charging cable cant be used directly to charge on laptop USB as it doesn't  have USB supported cable. For headphone/earphone and charging cable you need to buy connector from the market as it wont support your old charger and earphones .Apple needs to increase the battery power of this mobile"
Just wow!,"Performance and camera is great. Screen is about mediocre. Battery is really bad and hardly gets to the end of the day if charged in the morning. This is a good buy if you‚Äôre low on budget and you get a great deal. Looks very neat and attractive though. Go for the black color if you‚Äôre in doubt, though it‚Äôs more grey than black but looks very classy. About a month now and had no issues apart from small battery."
Super!,A good budget phone from Apple. A powerful machine at a reduced price. Owner‚Äùs pride neighbours envy. Easy to handle and the traditional looks of an I Phone gives a feel good factor.
Simply awesome,Working awesome. I got this phone for 25 k during big billion days. Camera quality is awesome.Playing free fire from past few days. No hanging ..A little heat yet it got resolved after making some settings changes.
Nice product,Its a little beast
Worth the money,"Except for battery performance, everything is fine with this."
Terrific,The overall product feels premium and nice!! The device has a compact size but the bezels feels kinda outdated !!! But still the performance it gives is next level and can‚Äôt be compared to any other device!!! Not for gamers though..!! The screen size is extremely small for gaming and battery life is also only for casual users and not for heavy users!! Battery will last on a average use around for 5 to 6 hours!!! Overall it‚Äôs a great product !!!
Simply awesome,Great phoneI got it for my daughterTotally satisfied with the price
Fabulous!,Good
Terrific purchase,"Nice,but battery life is very short"
Highly recommended,As apple mobiles are excellent in use. this is also one of them
Just okay,Heating issue
Good quality product (1 months usage),Except for the battery I am happy with the phone. Everything is good. and this is my first ever i phone. So once you get adapted you wont go back.
Terrific purchase,"I‚Äôm pretty much satisfied with my purchase of this phone. For all those commenting on the battery life of this phone , it gives a decent 9-10 hrs backup after a full charge which is normally acceptable if u are not a phone frenzy."
Very Good,Charging point issue. Phone is not getting charged so I had to go service centre. Disapointed.
Just wow!,Awesome
Value-for-money,"Charger should have been provided. Although mentioned on the website that this box is without charger, it would have been better if they would have added a fast charger. Makes no sense buying the car without keys."
Terrific,Best performance in small size ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Fabulous!,"The reasonable apple one can afford and fulfill there dreams,definitely after using it realised the difference of apple with my other phone"
Great product,Great product
Must buy!,Nice
Does the job,Billing not currently
Awesome,Awsome
Fabulous!,"Excellent. I wanted a handy phone with a good processor. After iPhone SE first version, I opted to go for this model. 12 mini was out of my budget."
Must buy!,"Excellent purchase. I wished for a iPhone since long time and finally I purchased one. Camera, speakers, performance.... everything is excellent. It's screen mirroring is in different level and it has more capability compare to android. You can even mirror jiotv and airtel extreme with it which is impossible in android It's the best"
Terrible product. Battery health dropped to 97% in 15 days,This is the worst apple product ever. I ordered Iphone SE with power adapter and headset but Flipkart sent me without Adapter. Their customer care told I placed the order and did not check while ordering.I had to order adapter with another 2000. I got the adapter from apple. Sad part is in just 15 days of use and hardly 16 to 18 charging cycle my batter health is now showing as 97%. Called apple care and they are telling it is normal. Seems apple is manufacturing less quality products and se...
Moderate,Facing battery issue.Only 4 hrs of battery backup.
Great product,I have been using iPhone earlier as well. This one is more brilliant phone with high performance speed and i love the perfect size of the phone
Terrific,"If you don't know the benefits of the Apple ecosystem, this is the phone to introduce you to it and if you use it properly, you will never go backIt's (comparatively) reasonably priced. In fact given it's processor which is the same as one in iPhone Pro which costs more than a lakh plus Apples' updates thay go on for 5-6 years, it's probably better value than most ""cheaper"" phones out there.The camera is great and Touch ID in this age of mask wearing is perfect. Cons - battery isn't as ..."
Just wow!,Great phone at this range (33k for 128gb). Phone is a powerhouse though it looks cute and small. Cons - can feel vibration on screen when u play high bass music. It seems that's applicable for all slim iphones without audio jack.

Value-for-money,"it‚Äôs a beast performance wise. period.Just go for it if bezels and small screen size doesn‚Äôt concern you. I like the screen size though, it‚Äôs not at small, it‚Äôs perfect and easily comes in hand perfectly.if you are switching from android, initially you may not like but after few days you will know why there is so much hype about apple. I am never going back to android."
Brilliant,"This has been one of the best variant including features that are a mixture of the other variants of Ô£ø iPhone. This 5 rating is just for the phone. The only problem I had was the delivery of the product. I received my product after 15 days, so a lot disappointed from Flipkart services and their team. Horrible services. For flipkart services I would rate in negative. Also majorly, a special note to people. If u feel u should not remove the plastic since it‚Äôs a new phone, I would recommend..."

Brilliant,Great product.
Horrible,Wastage of money....That is why rate got reduced sharply during sale.
Highly recommended,"iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof..Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it.It is good for email surfing, browsing, couple of videos per day.Camera quality is not superb but good in day lightVideo is extraordinary i can sayPerformance speed is tremendousBattery approx 1800mah is equivalent to 4000mah of other brands.White color stand unique in crowd.. because black color become traditional for all mobile handsets..Can go..."

Hated it!,"While buying it was written that earpod and charger are the part of this package . But no charger and earpod was in side the box not it was delivered in separate other box . It,s pathetic that you need to spend another 10 k to buy more . Feel cheated and thinking to return it . No support was also give from flip cart.. no phone call is received from them even after contacting them through chat . Very unprofessional"

Horrible,Battery is draining soon. Performance wise it's good
Does the job,Writing this review after 7 months of moderate use. Only two sentences:Everything is okay.Except battery. You need to charge 4 times a day or more. Not for gaming at all!
Fabulous!,"I was very scared to order from online site.But thankyou flipkart for keeping my trust.The product was delivered on 3days and it was well packed.Now about the phone it's my first iphone so I liked it from camera ,,to display to everything,, till now I didn't find any issues,, battery is enough for me.But the screen is little but small for those who habit of useing big screen will find little bit difficult at first.But with time it wil okayü•∞"
Bad quality,"This is my 4th iPhone and 1st Made in India iPhone, rest all are Assembled in China phones. Biggest issue I see in this iPhone is its battery. We all know that the battery backup of iPhone will be average, but this the the battery life itself is worst. In less than 6months, the battery life approaches 90%. It will hardly survive 2 years unlike other iPhone which could easily lasts for 4 years."
Just wow!,Good.
Mind-blowing purchase,GOOD for old IOS users
Awesome,Awesome phone
Just okay,"During app calls, especially through WhatsApp,  for 1hour22mins it goes down from 100% to 58% literally.I've turned off the following 1)background internet usage of app, 2)auto brightness is off, 3)screen time is off, 4)auto lock set in 30 seconds,5)No gaming at all, not a single time, after all this that is what I've got as a result.If you don't touch the phone after 100%, it stays at 98% after 24hours.This is where it sucks alot, aka battery, all good features against this dropback..."

Not recommended at all,"After a week of usage, battery life reduced drastically. In a bare minimum scenario, where I am not doing any heavy lifting like playing games, recording etc. Still battery life is not good at all."
Just wow!,"People are commenting battery is not upto mark,i dont know how they are using their phone because i am getting 6-7 hours of screen on time while using it for day to to activities and getting 5 hours of screen of time if iplay little bit of games in in my daily routine"
Simply awesome,Worth of money
Battery Health dropped to 97% in 30 days!,"I don't know if it's just me, the Battery Health has dropped to 97% within a month. I use the normal charger which I got in the box and the same cable too. I charge it to 80% and don't let it run below 20%. This is really weird"
Must buy!,"Looks outdated on the outside indeed but it‚Äôs a beast inside. Nevertheless feels premium ,Snappy processor with no lags at all."
Brilliant,This is a small beast.....

Worth the money,"Am not of a Iphone user being this my first Iphone, and earlier I have used Motorola one Power, Redmi 3S Prime and some of the battery efficient android phones, charge doesn‚Äôt t last much. Iphone has it‚Äôs name over battery inefficiency, so can be ignored. And since I had a screen size specific requirement, I have no regrets. Shifting from Android to IOS, is a bit messy. Overall performance of the phone is decent. I feel I paid hefty for the brand image of Apple."
Decent product,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è fantastic phone..  camera , battery life is good üòä"
Terrible product,1st time using iphone Worst battery performance When mobile data on with in a hour Battery comes down from 100% to 10%Very worst battery performanceWhen data on mobile gets heating up lot

Only the issue is flipkart delivery."
Absolute rubbish!,"After using in less then 2 month battery health gone down by 2 %.Phone battery create several issue . waste to buy not charged more then 87% its tuck during charging , sometimes its shows charges by 89 % and suddenly show 56%"
Could be way better,Phone performance is ok but battery  performance  is the worst thing in this time

Delightful,phone is very good But small size ?
Good quality product,"Nice small screen phoneWorks smoothly and battery last for a day of normal useBut it charges very fast, so no issues with battery"
Worth every penny,Only 1 word : Awesome
I expect this to be best but unfortunately last,Design is awesome and one of the primary reason to buy. But build quality have compromised as in one month the back galss got scraches but its ok and vary from user to user.Camara is best in this price but if you use it it eats battery like hell which I dont liked.Gamming is also good but again eats battery not good If you play games more often you need to charge it.In my opinion I am not happy as my usage remains same for old iPhone SE  and new iPhone SE 2020. If you need a phone and y...
Pretty good,"I ordered the black colour, but the back side is dark grey and not black. No other complaints. Best phone if you want a small phone that does everything."
Highly recommended,Awesome mobile for one handed user. Battery is not to bad. Performance is too good. Thanks to apple and flipkart
Brilliant,Awesome product üòçüòç
Very Good,"The phone is very fast and good for an average user. My only problem with this is the charger that came in the box. It feels very flimsy and plasticky compared to the smooth and premium feeling that the phone gives. I also wish the camera had portrait mode for objects too. But, overall excellent value for money!"
Worth every penny,Great product as usual. Good for a days use. Need a fast charger with it to get the best performance in short time. There‚Äôs nothing to complain except battery performance.
Brilliant,Nice phone...
Perfect product!,One of the best phone I have ever seen ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòç
Just wow!,"I have been using the iPhone se 2020 for close to a week now and I am super happy with the experience. As you might have seen in multiple reviews of the device, the battery life is a setback. But the battery easily lasts for a day with a good amount of gaming and video streaming and that works for a user like me."
Fabulous!,"Indeed so much to love, üòç"
Must buy!,The phone is super except for the battery which is not good
Terrific purchase,awesome phone worth it to buy.
"Authentic, Smart Performer","In Simple word, Can say WOW!!!What a Camera, In-build Quality & Performance.Every once says battery is a hitch, Obviously if any one perform well then their energy level drains.Iphone SE 2020 is a super performer, So definitely energy (battery) drains. You have to charge.Go for it"
Excellent,Fantastic product. Long lasting. Longer updates you will get.  Get it now.
Simply awesome,After long time i changing my iPhone 5s to SE. worth for money. I don‚Äôt see any battery problem as well.
Mind-blowing purchase,Nice mobile
Good choice,"Coming from an iPhone 6, this one feels like heaven regarding performance. Red should‚Äôve been more vibrant. Not for night photography. And also the image stabilisation is not good. Valuable for money though üëçüèΩ"
Wonderful,Product is good.. but pay on delivery option does not accept card/paytm/googlePay payment.!! This is not very much convinience for customer. Flipkart should also implement Paytm/GooglePay option in case of  pay on delivery situation.
Perfect product!,Battery work like 4500 mah and camera is awesome
Just okay,"Received iphone se 2020 after 10 long days.Initially battery was being discharged very fast but after a day or two with some settings done everything seems ok as of now.No comparison of other phones with iphone. Worth a buy. Got at Rs. 38,800 after HDFC credit card instant discount.I will purchase one more for myself and one again for my daughter"
Brilliant,"Absolutely amazing in all aspects,battery will be the only thing u should think.flipkard service always good"
Terrific purchase,I am fully satisfied after getting the iphone se 2020in my Hand what I was expecting....Ultimate cell phone.üëçüëåüòçüòä
Great Purchase: Worth the Investment,"Shifted from Android to iOS. Do not think twice before buying it. I was very skeptical initially, was confused between Oneplus and SE 2020, but i haven't regretted for a single moment. Size is very comfortable to hold and unlike the general perception, battery does last long. Especially for an average user( 5-6 hours of screen time) battery will never be an issue. Also, camera quality is very good."
Good quality product,Best phoneiPhone is iPhoneAwesome performance
Utterly Disappointed,Phone is ok but the delivery service is bad . Packing was bad
Terrific purchase,Premium design excellent performance
Highly recommended,This is my first I-phone and I am really happy for switching android to iPhone.value for money..display is  awesome..specially u will love this product if u r used to with small display phones.
Best in the market!,Incredible......!!!!The best phone to go for at an affordable price and far more interesting featired.
Terrific purchase,"Received in 2 days! Excellent delivery by Flipkart! About the phone, needless to say it is an Apple. I rest my case there."
Highly recommended,Worth. Take it.
Does the job,"It‚Äôs look like iPhone 6  and when you touch the home button it‚Äôs feel hard and when you turn on speaker during call it will vibrate and even playing the candy crash, Not for worth for money, camera was good but battery was worst if you are using continuesly it will try with in 6 hours."
Moderate,First time i using this only three days is over and my feedback is -I don't know why i moved on from Android to iOS! Battery performance is too much poor on this device and battery draining too much and heating within 5 minutes after entering videos calling or meeting. Maximum three hours can use. Totally waste of money thinking for exchange
Worth every penny,"I‚Äôm using iPhone SE 1st gen since 5 years and was waiting for SE2 since a long time! It‚Äôs nice upgrade when you‚Äôre a fan of SE! Design, performance, interface is obvious apple standard so no need to mention anything in detail!"
Very poor,Bettery backup is very bad
Not good,"I trusted and brought this product. But this phone battery is draining very fast,even not withstanding 2 hour back up. No solution from apple product support team. This phone is waste of money."
Does the job,Wonderful performance with disgusting battery health! After 7 days use it‚Äôs showing 92% battery health. The battery lasts maximum 3 hours screen on time. Don‚Äôt buy it!
Delightful,"Amazing phone if you want to get into the ""Apple Ecosystem"".If you need a secondary phone then it is definitely a no brainer! Just Buy! Great IOS experience! And yes....You have to buy a charger separatelyüôÇ"
Simply awesome,Lovely phone ‚ù§Ô∏èüì±
Awesome,Value for money
Pretty good,As usual apart from the battery the phone is worth it.
Must buy!,"My first ever iPhone.I was planning to buy an iPhone since iPhone 3GüòÇüòÇ.Other phone may have 108mp quad cam,12gb ram,600ppi,1200nits, 6.7inch display and bla bla ....Its not even having half of it..It‚Äôs not just a phone it‚Äôs an iphone and love it...Performance wise it‚Äôs a beast.

Still working out lot of things,let‚Äôs see ....some photos I clicked..it‚Äôs not all camera..the weather was stunning"
Absolutely JUNK PHONE !!!!,Worst product. Apple's quality of this product is poor by any standard. It has manufacturing defects. The sound output is bad. It is a pain to operate apple software. It is inferior to Android. Don't even buy. Its accessories are overpriced. So never ever buy an apple product. Its overhyped. It offers a quality that has deteriorated significantly over the past 5 years. AVOID !!!
Excellent,Awesome beauty.
Slightly disappointed,"Before buy this phone... Just read the following drawback...1.Display is the worst part of this phone, so much tiny, and not good display as Amoled. It's just an bad LCD display.2.Battery Life too much worst. If you play pubg for 1hour It's drop 75%üò≠. For daily normal use, It's last only for 3.5 hour... Don't expect much from 1800Mah approx battery.3.RAM  managements is not good at all. It kill the heavy graphics application. Its not avoidable in the price range 40K.4.I feel processor is..."
Wonderful,"The performance of the phone is next level, with A13 Bionic chip super se uper but the phone's battery life are very disappointing, phone ki battery life khuch achi nhi hai pubg khelte samay 2 ghante mai phone switch off ho jata hai. Aur display bhi khuch jada hi choti hai dhire dhire ap used to ho jaoge magar battery very down side."
Good choice,Good prouduct and battery is very poor
Wonderful,Ultimate camera I click front and back camera photos and performance is also supper I compared with iPhone 8 which I used perversely üî•üî•üî•üòç
Bad quality,"Huge disappointmentDo not spend your money just for apple logo. Small screen, half day battery life, average camera, no customisation. Go buy some value for money android phone until you can afford a real iPhone."
Brilliant,Thanks üòä flipkart A1 performance ü§©Camera quality is great üòå like dslr photo
Very poor,Phone keeps turning off...it's only been a day since I bought my phone
Worthless,I bought 10 days before.. battery life is just 2 hours..Worst experience buying this phone
Very poor,"Don't buy any product from Flipkart, they are least supportive it you are in trouble with your purchase with Flipkart. Bad experience."
Don't waste your money,Waste mobile please don‚Äôt waste ur money after receiving my phone battery performance is not at all good just for normal use also it will drain so fast and it‚Äôs showing return but it‚Äôs not true Flipkart will not bother about our complaint only No use and no help Please don‚Äôt buy
Could be way better,"Don‚Äôt ever switch to iPhone from Android... I hate it already.... This low cost phone is the trap into iPhone ecosystem, and never make any justification.... so much of limitations, trying to replace for Android again"
Nice,The battery drains faster than u can imagine Rest all features are good
Waste of money!,Battery is very poor . It coudnt stay for full day even without using net also..If you need primary phone don't buy it.Second sim is digital sim.
Perfect product!,Nice product

Wonderful,My first iphone ü•∞ value for money
Mind-blowing purchase,"I am using it for almost 2 weeks..awesome in this price..every aspect is good..battery backup is also good not sure why battery rating in flipkart is so less..I am also a Youtuber, from that aspect this is also very worthy..overall a very good product."
Good quality product,"My first Iphone purchase..and what u get is a small screen phone and a small battery back up..Is it worth?I think..as of now yes...Camera is great,Phone works smooth,superb display.

Simply awesome,Good
Worth every penny,"I have upgraded from iPhone 7 so let me start with saying I am not at all feeling bad about the small screen this phone comes with. More it‚Äôs compact. The phone comes with the power packed A13 3rd gen chipset, for this price this phone out does all premium androids and flagship androids. Also IPhone SE 2020 is to end the family rivalry XR. This is new standard in mobile tech, high build quality, up to date tech, compact (small for large screen likers), post modern accessibility tech and camer..."
Super!,Best
Delightful,The model i got is Assembled in INDIA which do-not have charger brick & EarPods The box only contains THE PHONE & THE CHARGING CABLE AND THE PAPER GUIDS WITH ONE APPLE STICKER100% The phone is value for the money
Mind-blowing purchase,"Awesome product, but only concern with battery."
Classy product,Delivery was very fast before 18 hours without any extra charges.
Simply awesome,It‚Äôs a great product from Apple and it‚Äôs worth buying.The delivery was on time.
Best in the market!,Just as you expect in an apple product. Disappointed with camera performance but the rest of features are great. So try the phone in hand before you decide to buy as it is indeed a small screen and you have to have a liking for such phones before you buy
Highly recommended,Totally satisfied with this product üòç
Value-for-money,Overall it is good but only drawback is the battery to be charged everyday
Wonderful,"No games installed, just with normal usage as well battery drains fast. Won't last for a day per full charge. Everything else is top notch."
Expected a better product,Battery big problem

Simply awesome,"Using I phone 6s from 4year and upgraded to SE 2020 Screen size is similar to 6S but feels more plush, speed is superb absolute no lag, I feel size of the phone is pretty decent for daily usage purpose, Battery life is also better one charge last long for a day,Overall value for money phone."
Awesome,"Apparently the camera is one of the best I‚Äôve come acrossComparing it with the oneplus 7 or 7T , being a single lens ; it outperformed the other two devices. I‚Äôve attached 2 image files along with this review and i just want all of you to understand that post shoot refining of the image, exposure and colour correction are equally important for a vibrant picture to pop out.All the professional landscape images we see around have been colour corrected, mostly. I have used the Adobe Light roo..."
Good choice,"Superb Device just go for it.Battery is also evident, camera is good but lacks clarity in low lighting !"
Just okay,Everything is good except the battery.
Mind-blowing purchase,"Excellent product, the people who wants to buy a budget friendly phone this is the best one"

Fabulous!,Nice product
Good quality product,"I bought this for its compact size , performance is very good . But if buying for calls (as it has compact size) them don't go for it. BATTERY IS REALLY BAD. u have to change twice a day on just calling ( if u get too much calls )"
Wonderful,Good
Simply awesome,Awsome camera awsome performance but battery could have been better

Great product,Good but battery can be give good back up
Just wow!,I am last 4 years use iPhone. Experience is good with iPhone üëçüëå
Good choice,Battery could have been better and there's definitely heating issues.Other than that can't complain much.
Excellent,Best one for me. I don't use my phone aggressively! I take care of my gadgets well and don't compare the Apple products with Android ones. The android users and apple users have a major  difference in what they want from their gadgets and I think it's really unfair to compare two different operating systems!
Value-for-money,"Switiching to iPhone from Android, you will never regret.Touch and ownership experience is excellent, no need to go more on this everyone knows this.Only thing is Battery DrainageEven if you moderately use, Like you are browsing through mails, social media scrolling sometime then you need to charge twice a day.IMPORTANT: Check carefully what you order includes charger adapter and earphones or not, the one i ordered did not include and i was disappointed, had to buy charger extra 2k INR."
Decent product,"Inside box you could not get charger and head phone,Battery is below average quality, Other wise this phone is ok condition and good built quality"
Nice,"I am writing this after 1 month of usage, battery backup is very bad and mobile has heating issues when you doesn‚Äôt charge with apple adapter."
Really Nice,Why always poor battery apple.... an apple can energize full body... but it don't have battery i think they have taken it seriously....ü§î

Wonderful,iPhone SE Camara Results is really awesome and Night Results is also very Good.... Nice look ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüëå
Mind-blowing purchase,Flipkart was decreasing the value of iphone
Just okay,"battery backup is a concern here, hardly gives a day backup with average use."
Super!,"If you are not into playing games on mobile and want to enter into apple environment, this is the best phone. Great camera, battery lasting for a day, and of course feel of IOS.On time delivery from Flipkart."
Terrific purchase,"Wow! First time I felt that this is not a garbage bin but a phone. I had similar kind of experience while using windows but Android is like a lot of useless things packed. I have no issues with the phone. But there are 3 areas where it might disappoint you.1. Display: It's not a problem for me as I seriously prefer this dispaly of iPhone notches on high-level phones. I hope we will see punch hole soon.2. Battery: Drains a bit faster.3. Gestures: If you are using a phones with gestures, u a..."

Perfect product!,I'm very happy with this iPhone...
Highly recommended,Awesome
Highly recommended,Apple at its best.. Strongly recommended....
Wonderful,"Battery backup isn‚Äôt as bad as many are reporting. If you are not a gamer, this phone should pretty much last a day on a normal usage. WhatsApp video call drains battery a lot. But i have seen that happening on Oneplus as well. So should be a general issue. Overall a nice handy phone. Must buy for people looking for a phone to use single hand."
Just wow!,"Good phone for basic use(chatting, calling, clicking few photos)Battery drains quickly on heavy use(watching videos or gaming)Got the 128gb version for 40k after applying offers so I felt it was worth it.Why to spend 30k on oppo,vivo etc"
Super!,Best mobile in the market and camera is mind blowing.
Just wow!,It is a very good phone at a very low price.Flagship processorBest cameraBest for those who want small phone

So far i haven‚Äôt faced any issue for Battery, if your useage is normal i dont think you will have a battery complain. Overall its good. Attaching a picture for reference."
good i phone in this price,"good product , baterry low , charge 2 times in a day , camera gd, speed also well"
Useless product,Mic is not working
Worth every penny,Awesome Product Not Bad
Worth every penny,Only 1 word : Awesome
Just okay,"Well basically I bought it because of the small size and the processor, so there's not any kind of problem. But battery could have been better, I know it's a small handset so battery will be small, but the rate at which battery drains is really bad."
Perfect product!,Just love the IPhone  ...SE2020
