5,5,Super!,Simply awesome device. Performance of this mobile is mind blowing. I'm playing pubg in Ultra HD with extreme smoothness. And I have seen in most of the reviews that the camera quality was bad. So that attaching the photos that I captured on my mobile Poco X3 Pro and added a little adjustments.

23,23,Terrible product,Been using it for > 1 month. In call proximity sensor doesnt work. Suddenly call goes on hold or goes to speaker mode due to face contact. To end call i have to click on end 3 times as it keeps jumping up and down. After applying tempered glass the touch response is pathetic. To scroll need to try multiple times as it wont detect scroll action on 1st attempt. Poco f1 was notches better in such simple things. Apart from processor its aa good as a Rs 5k phone. Pathetic.,1,Negative

36,36,Really Nice,In gaming perspective u will see stunning visuals in every game as it's meant to do so ! For camera if you click in pro mode you'll get 22mb images and you will be amazed how good the camera is but then a subtle reminder will tell you that you bought it for Snapdragon 860👹Front camera makes your skin tone lighter and doesn't give natural skin tone(had to say this)!!,4,Positive

42,42,Very Good,Camera is not bad. Macro mode works well. Poco should update some features like call recording. Call recording facility is very poor. Call recording quality also very poor. U can't record all calls. You can only record numbers which are not saved in your contacts. For saved contacts you need to add each  number one by one manually. Which is very horrible.

62,62,Good choice,Mainly as we know it's a device which totally based on proformance no doubt it's performance is good enough.. Battery life is not as expected it Only get discharged in 5-6 hours in gaming mode.. I'm using it from past 2days..these are things which I mainly felt ☺☺....

68,68,Simply awesome,Worthy and most noticeable thing in this smartphone is u r getting Snapdragon 860 with smooth performance in between 16000 INR whatever things  need in a  smartphone  u r getting all that in one phone ....

78,78,Really Nice,POCO X3 Pro is really a good device and value for money. This device performance is awesome software wise. Camera quality is also nice.Overall I would say someone will not regret after buying this device.Flipkart is offering EMI on Debit card for payment which is really good. But the old phone exchange system is not good because flipkart doesn't take the phone and provide discount as they promise. It happened with me that i have to pay the amount at the time of collecting my new phone.,4,Positive
